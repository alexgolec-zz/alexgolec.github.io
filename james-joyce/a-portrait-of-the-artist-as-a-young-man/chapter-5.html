The yellow dripping had been scooped out like a boghole and the pool under it brought back to his memory the dark turf-coloured water of the bath in Clongowes. The box of pawn tickets at his elbow had just been rifled and he took up idly one after another in his greasy fingers the blue and white dockets, scrawled and sanded and creased and bearing the name of the pledger as Daly or MacEvoy.</p></div><div id="container-1242"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1242">1 Pair Buskins. 1 D.

I know how it has changed you.</p></div><div id="container-1266"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1266">--Good morning, everybody, said Stephen, smiling and kissing the tips of his fingers in adieu.</p></div><div id="container-1267"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1267">The lane behind the terrace was waterlogged and as he went down it slowly, choosing his steps amid heaps of wet rubbish, he heard a mad nun screeching in the nuns' madhouse beyond the wall.</p></div><div id="container-1268"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1268">--Jesus! O Jesus! Jesus!</p></div><div id="container-1269"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1269">He shook the sound out of his ears by an angry toss of his head and hurried on, stumbling through the mouldering offal, his heart already bitten by an ache of loathing and bitterness. His father's whistle, his mother's mutterings, the screech of an unseen maniac were to him now so many voices offending and threatening to humble the pride of his youth. He drove their echoes even out of his heart with an execration; but, as he walked down the avenue and felt the grey morning light falling about him through the dripping trees and smelt the strange wild smell of the wet leaves and bark, his soul was loosed of her miseries.</p></div><div id="container-1270"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1270">The rain-laden trees of the avenue evoked in him, as always, memories of the girls and women in the plays of Gerhart Hauptmann; and the memory of their pale sorrows and the fragrance falling from the wet branches mingled in a mood of quiet joy. His morning walk across the city had begun, and he foreknew that as he passed the sloblands of Fairview he would think of the cloistral silver-veined prose of Newman; that as he walked along the North Strand Road, glancing idly at the windows of the provision shops, he would recall the dark humour of Guido Cavalcanti and smile; that as he went by Baird's stonecutting works in Talbot Place the spirit of Ibsen would blow through him like a keen wind, a spirit of wayward boyish beauty; and that passing a grimy marine dealer's shop beyond the Liffey he would repeat the song by Ben Jonson which begins:</p></div><div id="container-1271"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1271">I was not wearier where I lay.</p></div><div id="container-1272"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1272">His mind when wearied of its search for the essence of beauty amid the spectral words of Aristotle or Aquinas turned often for its pleasure to the dainty songs of the Elizabethans. His mind, in the vesture of a doubting monk, stood often in shadow under the windows of that age, to hear the grave and mocking music of the lutenists or the frank laughter of waist-coateers until a laugh too low, a phrase, tarnished by time, of chambering and false honour stung his monkish pride and drove him on from his lurking-place.</p></div><div id="container-1273"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1273">The lore which he was believed to pass his days brooding upon so that it had rapt him from the companionship of youth was only a garner of slender sentences from Aristotle's poetics and psychology and a SYNOPSIS PHILOSOPHIAE SCHOLASTICAE AD MENTEM DIVI THOMAE. His thinking was a dusk of doubt and self-mistrust, lit up at moments by the lightnings of intuition, but lightnings of so clear a splendour that in those moments the world perished about his feet as if it had been fire-consumed; and thereafter his tongue grew heavy and he met the eyes of others with unanswering eyes, for he felt that the spirit of beauty had folded him round like a mantle and that in revery at least he had been acquainted with nobility. But when this brief pride of silence upheld him no longer he was glad to find himself still in the midst of common lives, passing on his way amid the squalor and noise and sloth of the city fearlessly and with a light heart.</p></div><div id="container-1274"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1274">Near the hoardings on the canal he met the consumptive man with the doll's face and the brimless hat coming towards him down the slope of the bridge with little steps, tightly buttoned into his chocolate overcoat, and holding his furled umbrella a span or two from him like a divining rod. It must be eleven, he thought, and peered into a dairy to see the time. The clock in the dairy told him that it was five minutes to five but, as he turned away, he heard a clock somewhere near him, but unseen, beating eleven strokes in swift precision. He laughed as he heard it for it made him think of McCann, and he saw him a squat figure in a shooting jacket and breeches and with a fair goatee, standing in the wind at Hopkins' corner, and heard him say:</p></div><div id="container-1275"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1275">--Dedalus, you're an antisocial being, wrapped up in yourself. I'm not. I'm a democrat and I'll work and act for social liberty and equality among all classes and sexes in the United States of the Europe of the future.</p></div><div id="container-1276"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1276">Eleven! Then he was late for that lecture too. What day of the week was it? He stopped at a newsagent's to read the headline of a placard. Thursday. Ten to eleven, English; eleven to twelve, French; twelve to one, physics. He fancied to himself the English lecture and felt, even at that distance, restless and helpless. He saw the heads of his classmates meekly bent as they wrote in their notebooks the points they were bidden to note, nominal definitions, essential definitions and examples or dates of birth or death, chief works, a favourable and an unfavourable criticism side by side. His own head was unbent for his thoughts wandered abroad and whether he looked around the little class of students or out of the window across the desolate gardens of the green an odour assailed him of cheerless cellar-damp and decay. Another head than his, right before him in the first benches, was poised squarely above its bending fellows like the head of a priest appealing without humility to the tabernacle for the humble worshippers about him. Why was it that when he thought of Cranly he could never raise before his mind the entire image of his body but only the image of the head and face? Even now against the grey curtain of the morning he saw it before him like the phantom of a dream, the face of a severed head or death-mask, crowned on the brows by its stiff black upright hair as by an iron crown. It was a priest-like face, priest-like in its palor, in the wide winged nose, in the shadowings below the eyes and along the jaws, priest-like in the lips that were long and bloodless and faintly smiling; and Stephen, remembering swiftly how he had told Cranly of all the tumults and unrest and longings in his soul, day after day and night by night, only to be answered by his friend's listening silence, would have told himself that it was the face of a guilty priest who heard confessions of those whom he had not power to absolve but that he felt again in memory the gaze of its dark womanish eyes.</p></div><div id="container-1277"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1277">Through this image he had a glimpse of a strange dark cavern of speculation but at once turned away from it, feeling that it was not yet the hour to enter it. But the nightshade of his friend's listlessness seemed to be diffusing in the air around him a tenuous and deadly exhalation and He found himself glancing from one casual word to another on his right or left in stolid wonder that they had been so silently emptied of instantaneous sense until every mean shop legend bound his mind like the words of a spell and his soul shrivelled up sighing with age as he walked on in a lane among heaps of dead language. His own consciousness of language was ebbing from his brain and trickling into the very words themselves which set to band and disband themselves in wayward rhythms:</p></div><div id="container-1278"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1278">The ivy whines upon the wall, And whines and twines upon the wall, The yellow ivy upon the wall, Ivy, ivy up the wall.</p></div><div id="container-1279"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1279">Did anyone ever hear such drivel? Lord Almighty! Who ever heard of ivy whining on a wall? Yellow ivy; that was all right. Yellow ivory also. And what about ivory ivy?</p></div><div id="container-1280"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1280">The word now shone in his brain, clearer and brighter than any ivory sawn from the mottled tusks of elephants. IVORY, IVOIRE, AVORIO, EBUR. One of the first examples that he had learnt in Latin had run: INDIA MITTIT EBUR; and he recalled the shrewd northern face of the rector who had taught him to construe the Metamorphoses of Ovid in a courtly English, made whimsical by the mention of porkers and potsherds and chines of bacon. He had learnt what little he knew of the laws of Latin verse from a ragged book written by a Portuguese priest.</p></div><div id="container-1281"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1281">Contrahit orator, variant in carmine vates.</p></div><div id="container-1282"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1282">The crises and victories and secessions in Roman history were handed on to him in the trite words IN TANTO DISCRIMINE and he had tried to peer into the social life of the city of cities through the words IMPLERE OLLAM DENARIORUM which the rector had rendered sonorously as the filling of a pot with denaries. The pages of his time-worn Horace never felt cold to the touch even when his own fingers were cold; they were human pages and fifty years before they had been turned by the human fingers of John Duncan Inverarity and by his brother, William Malcolm Inverarity. Yes, those were noble names on the dusky flyleaf and, even for so poor a Latinist as he, the dusky verses were as fragrant as though they had lain all those years in myrtle and lavender and vervain; but yet it wounded him to think that he would never be but a shy guest at the feast of the world's culture and that the monkish learning, in terms of which he was striving to forge out an esthetic philosophy, was held no higher by the age he lived in than the subtle and curious jargons of heraldry and falconry.</p></div><div id="container-1283"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1283">The grey block of Trinity on his left, set heavily in the city's ignorance like a dull stone set in a cumbrous ring, pulled his mind downward and while he was striving this way and that to free his feet from the fetters of the reformed conscience he came upon the droll statue of the national poet of Ireland.</p></div><div id="container-1284"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1284">He looked at it without anger; for, though sloth of the body and of the soul crept over it like unseen vermin, over the shuffling feet and up the folds of the cloak and around the servile head, it seemed humbly conscious of its indignity. It was a Firbolg in the borrowed cloak of a Milesian; and he thought of his friend Davin, the peasant student. It was a jesting name between them, but the young peasant bore with it lightly:</p></div><div id="container-1285"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1285">--Go on, Stevie, I have a hard head, you tell me. Call me what you will.</p></div><div id="container-1286"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1286">The homely version of his christian name on the lips of his friend had touched Stephen pleasantly when first heard for he was as formal in speech with others as they were with him. Often, as he sat in Davin's rooms in Grantham Street, wondering at his friend's well-made boots that flanked the wall pair by pair and repeating for his friend's simple ear the verses and cadences of others which were the veils of his own longing and dejection, the rude Firbolg mind of his listener had drawn his mind towards it and flung it back again, drawing it by a quiet inbred courtesy of attention or by a quaint turn of old English speech or by the force of its delight in rude bodily skill--for Davin had sat at the feet of Michael Cusack, the Gael--repelling swiftly and suddenly by a grossness of intelligence or by a bluntness of feeling or by a dull stare of terror in the eyes, the terror of soul of a starving Irish village in which the curfew was still a nightly fear.</p></div><div id="container-1287"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1287">Side by side with his memory of the deeds of prowess of his uncle Mat Davin, the athlete, the young peasant worshipped the sorrowful legend of Ireland. The gossip of his fellow-students which strove to render the flat life of the college significant at any cost loved to think of him as a young fenian. His nurse had taught him Irish and shaped his rude imagination by the broken lights of Irish myth. He stood towards the myth upon which no individual mind had ever drawn out a line of beauty and to its unwieldy tales that divided against themselves as they moved down the cycles in the same attitude as towards the Roman catholic religion, the attitude of a dull-witted loyal serf. Whatsoever of thought or of feeling came to him from England or by way of English culture his mind stood armed against in obedience to a password; and of the world that lay beyond England he knew only the foreign legion of France in which he spoke of serving.</p></div><div id="container-1288"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1288">Coupling this ambition with the young man's humour Stephen had often called him one of the tame geese and there was even a point of irritation in the name pointed against that very reluctance of speech and deed in his friend which seemed so often to stand between Stephen's mind, eager of speculation, and the hidden ways of Irish life.</p></div><div id="container-1289"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1289">One night the young peasant, his spirit stung by the violent or luxurious language in which Stephen escaped from the cold silence of intellectual revolt, had called up before Stephen's mind a strange vision. The two were walking slowly towards Davin's rooms through the dark narrow streets of the poorer jews.</p></div><div id="container-1290"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1290">--A thing happened to myself, Stevie, last autumn, coming on winter, and I never told it to a living soul and you are the first person now I ever told it to. I disremember if it was October or November. It was October because it was before I came up here to join the matriculation class.</p></div><div id="container-1291"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1291">Stephen had turned his smiling eyes towards his friend's face, flattered by his confidence and won over to sympathy by the speaker's simple accent.</p></div><div id="container-1292"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1292">--I was away all that day from my own place over in Buttevant.</p></div><div id="container-1293"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1293">--I don't know if you know where that is--at a hurling match between the Croke's Own Boys and the Fearless Thurles and by God, Stevie, that was the hard fight. My first cousin, Fonsy Davin, was stripped to his buff that day minding cool for the Limericks but he was up with the forwards half the time and shouting like mad. I never will forget that day. One of the Crokes made a woeful wipe at him one time with his caman and I declare to God he was within an aim's ace of getting it at the side of his temple. Oh, honest to God, if the crook of it caught him that time he was done for.</p></div><div id="container-1294"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1294">--I am glad he escaped, Stephen had said with a laugh, but surely that's not the strange thing that happened you?</p></div><div id="container-1295"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1295">--Well, I suppose that doesn't interest you, but leastways there was such noise after the match that I missed the train home and I couldn't get any kind of a yoke to give me a lift for, as luck would have it, there was a mass meeting that same day over in Castletownroche and all the cars in the country were there. So there was nothing for it only to stay the night or to foot it out. Well, I started to walk and on I went and it was coming on night when I got into the Ballyhoura hills, that's better than ten miles from Kilmallock and there's a long lonely road after that. You wouldn't see the sign of a christian house along the road or hear a sound. It was pitch dark almost. Once or twice I stopped by the way under a bush to redden my pipe and only for the dew was thick I'd have stretched out there and slept. At last, after a bend of the road, I spied a little cottage with a light in the window. I went up and knocked at the door. A voice asked who was there and I answered I was over at the match in Buttevant and was walking back and that I'd be thankful for a glass of water. After a while a young woman opened the door and brought me out a big mug of milk. She was half undressed as if she was going to bed when I knocked and she had her hair hanging and I thought by her figure and by something in the look of her eyes that she must be carrying a child. She kept me in talk a long while at the door, and I thought it strange because her breast and her shoulders were bare. She asked me was I tired and would I like to stop the night there. She said she was all alone in the house and that her husband had gone that morning to Queenstown with his sister to see her off. And all the time she was talking, Stevie, she had her eyes fixed on my face and she stood so close to me I could hear her breathing. When I handed her back the mug at last she took my hand to draw me in over the threshold and said: 'COME IN AND STAY THE NIGHT HERE. YOU'VE NO CALL TO BE FRIGHTENED. THERE'S NO ONE IN IT BUT OURSELVES...' I didn't go in, Stevie. I thanked her and went on my way again, all in a fever. At the first bend of the road I looked back and she was standing at the door.</p></div><div id="container-1296"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1296">The last words of Davin's story sang in his memory and the figure of the woman in the story stood forth reflected in other figures of the peasant women whom he had seen standing in the doorways at Clane as the college cars drove by, as a type of her race and of his own, a bat-like soul waking to the consciousness of itself in darkness and secrecy and loneliness and, through the eyes and voice and gesture of a woman without guile, calling the stranger to her bed.</p></div><div id="container-1297"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1297">A hand was laid on his arm and a young voice cried:</p></div><div id="container-1298"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1298">--Ah, gentleman, your own girl, sir! The first handsel today, gentleman. Buy that lovely bunch. Will you, gentleman?</p></div><div id="container-1299"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1299">The blue flowers which she lifted towards him and her young blue eyes seemed to him at that instant images of guilelessness, and he halted till the image had vanished and he saw only her ragged dress and damp coarse hair and hoydenish face.</p></div><div id="container-1300"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1300">--Do, gentleman!

Grafton Street, along which he walked, prolonged that moment of discouraged poverty. In the roadway at the head of the street a slab was set to the memory of Wolfe Tone and he remembered having been present with his father at its laying. He remembered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute. There were four French delegates in a brake and one, a plump smiling young man, held, wedged on a stick, a card on which were printed the words: VIVE L'IRLANDE!</p></div><div id="container-1307"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1307">But the trees in Stephen's Green were fragrant of rain and the rain-sodden earth gave forth its mortal odour, a faint incense rising upward through the mould from many hearts. The soul of the gallant venal city which his elders had told him of had shrunk with time to a faint mortal odour rising from the earth and he knew that in a moment when he entered the sombre college he would be conscious of a corruption other than that of Buck Egan and Burnchapel Whaley.</p></div><div id="container-1308"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1308">It was too late to go upstairs to the French class. He crossed the hall and took the corridor to the left which led to the physics theatre. The corridor was dark and silent but not unwatchful. Why did he feel that it was not unwatchful? Was it because he had heard that in Buck Whaley's time there was a secret staircase there? Or was the jesuit house extra-territorial and was he walking among aliens? The Ireland of Tone and of Parnell seemed to have receded in space.</p></div><div id="container-1309"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1309">He opened the door of the theatre and halted in the chilly grey light that struggled through the dusty windows. A figure was crouching before the large grate and by its leanness and greyness he knew that it was the dean of studies lighting the fire. Stephen closed the door quietly and approached the fireplace.</p></div><div id="container-1310"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1310">--Good morning, sir! Can I help you?</p></div><div id="container-1311"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1311">The priest looked up quickly and said:</p></div><div id="container-1312"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1312">--One moment now, Mr Dedalus, and you will see. There is an art in lighting a fire. We have the liberal arts and we have the useful arts. This is one of the useful arts.</p></div><div id="container-1313"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1313">--I will try to learn it, said Stephen.</p></div><div id="container-1314"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1314">--Not too much coal, said the dean, working briskly at his task, that is one of the secrets.</p></div><div id="container-1315"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1315">He produced four candle-butts from the side-pockets of his soutane and placed them deftly among the coals and twisted papers. Stephen watched him in silence. Kneeling thus on the flagstone to kindle the fire and busied with the disposition of his wisps of paper and candle-butts he seemed more than ever a humble server making ready the place of sacrifice in an empty temple, a levite of the Lord. Like a levite's robe of plain linen the faded worn soutane draped the kneeling figure of one whom the canonicals or the bell-bordered ephod would irk and trouble. His very body had waxed old in lowly service of the Lord--in tending the fire upon the altar, in bearing tidings secretly, in waiting upon worldlings, in striking swiftly when bidden--and yet had remained ungraced by aught of saintly or of prelatic beauty. Nay, his very soul had waxed old in that service without growing towards light and beauty or spreading abroad a sweet odour of her sanctity--a mortified will no more responsive to the thrill of its obedience than was to the thrill of love or combat his ageing body, spare and sinewy, greyed with a silver-pointed down.</p></div><div id="container-1316"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1316">The dean rested back on his hunkers and watched the sticks catch. Stephen, to fill the silence, said:</p></div><div id="container-1317"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1317">--I am sure I could not light a fire.</p></div><div id="container-1318"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1318">--You are an artist, are you not, Mr Dedalus? said the dean, glancing up and blinking his pale eyes. The object of the artist is the creation of the beautiful. What the beautiful is is another question.</p></div><div id="container-1319"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1319">He rubbed his hands slowly and drily over the difficulty.</p></div><div id="container-1320"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1320">--Can you solve that question now? he asked.</p></div><div id="container-1321"><p chunktype="misc" class="misc" id="chunk-1321">--Aquinas, answered Stephen, says PULCRA SUNT QUAE VISA PLACENT.</p></div><div id="container-1322"><ul chunktype="poetry" class="poetry" id="chunk-1322"><li class="poetry-line" id="chunk-1322-line-1">--This fire before us, said the dean, will be pleasing to the eye.</li><li class="poetry-line" id="chunk-1322-line-2">Will it therefore be beautiful?</li></ul></div><div id="container-1323"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1323">--In so far as it is apprehended by the sight, which I suppose means here esthetic intellection, it will be beautiful. But Aquinas also says BONUM EST IN QUOD TENDIT APPETITUS. In so far as it satisfies the animal craving for warmth fire is a good. In hell, however, it is an evil.</p></div><div id="container-1324"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1324">--Quite so, said the dean, you have certainly hit the nail on the head.</p></div><div id="container-1325"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1325">He rose nimbly and went towards the door, set it ajar and said:</p></div><div id="container-1326"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1326">--A draught is said to be a help in these matters.</p></div><div id="container-1327"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1327">As he came back to the hearth, limping slightly but with a brisk step, Stephen saw the silent soul of a jesuit look out at him from the pale loveless eyes. Like Ignatius he was lame but in his eyes burned no spark of Ignatius's enthusiasm. Even the legendary craft of the company, a craft subtler and more secret than its fabled books of secret subtle wisdom, had not fired his soul with the energy of apostleship. It seemed as if he used the shifts and lore and cunning of the world, as bidden to do, for the greater glory of God, without joy in their handling or hatred of that in them which was evil but turning them, with a firm gesture of obedience back upon themselves and for all this silent service it seemed as if he loved not at all the master and little, if at all, the ends he served. SIMILITER ATQUE SENIS BACULUS, he was, as the founder would have had him, like a staff in an old man's hand, to be leaned on in the road at nightfall or in stress of weather, to lie with a lady's nosegay on a garden seat, to be raised in menace.</p></div><div id="container-1328"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1328">The dean returned to the hearth and began to stroke his chin.</p></div><div id="container-1329"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1329">--When may we expect to have something from you on the esthetic question? he asked.</p></div><div id="container-1330"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1330">--From me! said Stephen in astonishment. I stumble on an idea once a fortnight if I am lucky.</p></div><div id="container-1331"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1331">--These questions are very profound, Mr Dedalus, said the dean. It is like looking down from the cliffs of Moher into the depths. Many go down into the depths and never come up. Only the trained diver can go down into those depths and explore them and come to the surface again.</p></div><div id="container-1332"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1332">--If you mean speculation, sir, said Stephen, I also am sure that there is no such thing as free thinking inasmuch as all thinking must be bound by its own laws.</p></div><div id="container-1333"><p chunktype="misc" class="misc" id="chunk-1333">--Ha!</p></div><div id="container-1334"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1334">--For my purpose I can work on at present by the light of one or two ideas of Aristotle and Aquinas.</p></div><div id="container-1335"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1335">--I see. I quite see your point.</p></div><div id="container-1336"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1336">--I need them only for my own use and guidance until I have done something for myself by their light. If the lamp smokes or smells I shall try to trim it. If it does not give light enough I shall sell it and buy another.</p></div><div id="container-1337"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1337">--Epictetus also had a lamp, said the dean, which was sold for a fancy price after his death. It was the lamp he wrote his philosophical dissertations by. You know Epictetus?</p></div><div id="container-1338"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1338">--An old gentleman, said Stephen coarsely, who said that the soul is very like a bucketful of water.</p></div><div id="container-1339"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1339">--He tells us in his homely way, the dean went on, that he put an iron lamp before a statue of one of the gods and that a thief stole the lamp. What did the philosopher do? He reflected that it was in the character of a thief to steal and determined to buy an earthen lamp next day instead of the iron lamp.</p></div><div id="container-1340"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1340">A smell of molten tallow came up from the dean's candle butts and fused itself in Stephen's consciousness with the jingle of the words, bucket and lamp and lamp and bucket. The priest's voice, too, had a hard jingling tone. Stephen's mind halted by instinct, checked by the strange tone and the imagery and by the priest's face which seemed like an unlit lamp or a reflector hung in a false focus. What lay behind it or within it? A dull torpor of the soul or the dullness of the thundercloud, charged with intellection and capable of the gloom of God?</p></div><div id="container-1341"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1341">--I meant a different kind of lamp, sir, said Stephen.</p></div><div id="container-1342"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1342">--Undoubtedly, said the dean.</p></div><div id="container-1343"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1343">--One difficulty, said Stephen, in esthetic discussion is to know whether words are being used according to the literary tradition or according to the tradition of the marketplace. I remember a sentence of Newman's in which he says of the Blessed Virgin that she was detained in the full company of the saints. The use of the word in the marketplace is quite different. I HOPE I AM NOT DETAINING YOU.</p></div><div id="container-1344"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1344">--Not in the least, said the dean politely.</p></div><div id="container-1345"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1345">--No, no, said Stephen, smiling, I mean--</p></div><div id="container-1346"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1346">--Yes, yes; I see, said the dean quickly, I quite catch the point: DETAIN.</p></div><div id="container-1347"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1347">He thrust forward his under jaw and uttered a dry short cough.</p></div><div id="container-1348"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1348">--To return to the lamp, he said, the feeding of it is also a nice problem. You must choose the pure oil and you must be careful when you pour it in not to overflow it, not to pour in more than the funnel can hold.</p></div><div id="container-1349"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1349">--What funnel? asked Stephen.</p></div><div id="container-1350"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1350">--The funnel through which you pour the oil into your lamp.</p></div><div id="container-1351"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1351">--That? said Stephen. Is that called a funnel? Is it not a tundish?</p></div><div id="container-1352"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1352">--What is a tundish?</p></div><div id="container-1353"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1353">--That. The... funnel.</p></div><div id="container-1354"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1354">--Is that called a tundish in Ireland? asked the dean. I never heard the word in my life.</p></div><div id="container-1355"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1355">--It is called a tundish in Lower Drumcondra, said Stephen, laughing, where they speak the best English.</p></div><div id="container-1356"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1356">--A tundish, said the dean reflectively. That is a most interesting word. I must look that word up. Upon my word I must.</p></div><div id="container-1357"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1357">His courtesy of manner rang a little false and Stephen looked at the English convert with the same eyes as the elder brother in the parable may have turned on the prodigal. A humble follower in the wake of clamorous conversions, a poor Englishman in Ireland, he seemed to have entered on the stage of jesuit history when that strange play of intrigue and suffering and envy and struggle and indignity had been all but given through--a late-comer, a tardy spirit. From what had he set out? Perhaps he had been born and bred among serious dissenters, seeing salvation in Jesus only and abhorring the vain pomps of the establishment. Had he felt the need of an implicit faith amid the welter of sectarianism and the jargon of its turbulent schisms, six principle men, peculiar people, seed and snake baptists, supralapsarian dogmatists? Had he found the true church all of a sudden in winding up to the end like a reel of cotton some fine-spun line of reasoning upon insufflation on the imposition of hands or the procession of the Holy Ghost? Or had Lord Christ touched him and bidden him follow, like that disciple who had sat at the receipt of custom, as he sat by the door of some zinc-roofed chapel, yawning and telling over his church pence?</p></div><div id="container-1358"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1358">The dean repeated the word yet again.</p></div><div id="container-1359"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1359">--Tundish! Well now, that is interesting!</p></div><div id="container-1360"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1360">--The question you asked me a moment ago seems to me more interesting. What is that beauty which the artist struggles to express from lumps of earth, said Stephen coldly.</p></div><div id="container-1361"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1361">The little word seemed to have turned a rapier point of his sensitiveness against this courteous and vigilant foe. He felt with a smart of dejection that the man to whom he was speaking was a countryman of Ben Jonson. He thought:</p></div><div id="container-1362"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1362">--The language in which we are speaking is his before it is mine. How different are the words HOME, CHRIST, ALE, MASTER, on his lips and on mine! I cannot speak or write these words without unrest of spirit. His language, so familiar and so foreign, will always be for me an acquired speech. I have not made or accepted its words. My voice holds them at bay. My soul frets in the shadow of his language.</p></div><div id="container-1363"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1363">--And to distinguish between the beautiful and the sublime, the dean added, to distinguish between moral beauty and material beauty. And to inquire what kind of beauty is proper to each of the various arts. These are some interesting points we might take up.</p></div><div id="container-1364"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1364">Stephen, disheartened suddenly by the dean's firm, dry tone, was silent; and through the silence a distant noise of many boots and confused voices came up the staircase.</p></div><div id="container-1365"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1365">--In pursuing these speculations, said the dean conclusively, there is, however, the danger of perishing of inanition. First you must take your degree. Set that before you as your first aim. Then, little by little, you will see your way. I mean in every sense, your way in life and in thinking. It may be uphill pedalling at first. Take Mr Moonan. He was a long time before he got to the top. But he got there.</p></div><div id="container-1366"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1366">--I may not have his talent, said Stephen quietly.</p></div><div id="container-1367"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1367">--You never know, said the dean brightly. We never can say what is in us. I most certainly should not be despondent. PER ASPERA AD ASTRA.</p></div><div id="container-1368"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1368">He left the hearth quickly and went towards the landing to oversee the arrival of the first arts' class.</p></div><div id="container-1369"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1369">Leaning against the fireplace Stephen heard him greet briskly and impartially every Student of the class and could almost see the frank smiles of the coarser students. A desolating pity began to fall like dew upon his easily embittered heart for this faithful serving-man of the knightly Loyola, for this half-brother of the clergy, more venal than they in speech, more steadfast of soul than they, one whom he would never call his ghostly father; and he thought how this man and his companions had earned the name of worldlings at the hands not of the unworldly only but of the worldly also for having pleaded, during all their history, at the bar of God's justice for the souls of the lax and the lukewarm and the prudent.</p></div><div id="container-1370"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1370">The entry of the professor was signalled by a few rounds of Kentish fire from the heavy boots of those students who sat on the highest tier of the gloomy theatre under the grey cobwebbed windows. The calling of the roll began and the responses to the names were given out in all tones until the name of Peter Byrne was reached.</p></div><div id="container-1371"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1371">--Here!</p></div><div id="container-1372"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1372">A deep bass note in response came from the upper tier, followed by coughs of protest along the other benches.</p></div><div id="container-1373"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1373">The professor paused in his reading and called the next name:</p></div><div id="container-1374"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1374">--Cranly!</p></div><div id="container-1375"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1375">No answer.</p></div><div id="container-1376"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1376">--Mr Cranly!</p></div><div id="container-1377"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1377">A smile flew across Stephen's face as he thought of his friend's studies.</p></div><div id="container-1378"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1378">--Try Leopardstown! Said a voice from the bench behind.</p></div><div id="container-1379"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1379">Stephen glanced up quickly but Moynihan's snoutish face, outlined on the grey light, was impassive. A formula was given out. Amid the rustling of the notebooks Stephen turned back again and said:</p></div><div id="container-1380"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1380">--Give me some paper for God's sake.</p></div><div id="container-1381"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1381">--Are you as bad as that? asked Moynihan with a broad grin.</p></div><div id="container-1382"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1382">He tore a sheet from his scribbler and passed it down, whispering:</p></div><div id="container-1383"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1383">--In case of necessity any layman or woman can do it.</p></div><div id="container-1384"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1384">The formula which he wrote obediently on the sheet of paper, the coiling and uncoiling calculations of the professor, the spectre-like symbols of force and velocity fascinated and jaded Stephen's mind. He had heard some say that the old professor was an atheist freemason. O the grey dull day! It seemed a limbo of painless patient consciousness through which souls of mathematicians might wander, projecting long slender fabrics from plane to plane of ever rarer and paler twilight, radiating swift eddies to the last verges of a universe ever vaster, farther and more impalpable.</p></div><div id="container-1385"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1385">--So we must distinguish between elliptical and ellipsoidal. Perhaps some of you gentlemen may be familiar with the works of Mr W. S. Gilbert. In one of his songs he speaks of the billiard sharp who is condemned to play:</p></div><div id="container-1386"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1386">On a cloth untrue With a twisted cue And elliptical billiard balls.</p></div><div id="container-1387"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1387">--He means a ball having the form of the ellipsoid of the principal axes of which I spoke a moment ago.</p></div><div id="container-1388"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1388">Moynihan leaned down towards Stephen's ear and murmured:</p></div><div id="container-1389"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1389">--What price ellipsoidal balls! chase me, ladies, I'm in the cavalry!</p></div><div id="container-1390"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1390">His fellow student's rude humour ran like a gust through the cloister of Stephen's mind, shaking into gay life limp priestly vestments that hung upon the walls, setting them to sway and caper in a sabbath of misrule. The forms of the community emerged from the gust-blown vestments, the dean of studies, the portly florid bursar with his cap of grey hair, the president, the little priest with feathery hair who wrote devout verses, the squat peasant form of the professor of economics, the tall form of the young professor of mental science discussing on the landing a case of conscience with his class like a giraffe cropping high leafage among a herd of antelopes, the grave troubled prefect of the sodality, the plump round-headed professor of Italian with his rogue's eyes. They came ambling and stumbling, tumbling and capering, kilting their gowns for leap frog, holding one another back, shaken with deep false laughter, smacking one another behind and laughing at their rude malice, calling to one another by familiar nicknames, protesting with sudden dignity at some rough usage, whispering two and two behind their hands.</p></div><div id="container-1391"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1391">The professor had gone to the glass cases on the side wall, from a shelf of which he took down a set of coils, blew away the dust from many points and, bearing it carefully to the table, held a finger on it while he proceeded with his lecture. He explained that the wires in modern coils were of a compound called platinoid lately discovered by F. W. Martino.</p></div><div id="container-1392"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1392">He spoke clearly the initials and surname of the discoverer. Moynihan whispered from behind:</p></div><div id="container-1393"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1393">--Good old Fresh Water Martin!</p></div><div id="container-1394"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1394">--Ask him, Stephen whispered back with weary humour, if he wants a subject for electrocution. He can have me.</p></div><div id="container-1395"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1395">Moynihan, seeing the professor bend over the coils, rose in his bench and, clacking noiselessly the fingers of his right hand, began to call with the voice of a slobbering urchin.</p></div><div id="container-1396"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1396">--Please teacher! This boy is after saying a bad word, teacher.</p></div><div id="container-1397"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1397">--Platinoid, the professor said solemnly, is preferred to German silver because it has a lower coefficient of resistance by changes of temperature. The platinoid wire is insulated and the covering of silk that insulates it is wound on the ebonite bobbins just where my finger is. If it were wound single an extra current would be induced in the coils. The bobbins are saturated in hot paraffin wax...</p></div><div id="container-1398"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1398">A sharp Ulster voice said from the bench below Stephen:</p></div><div id="container-1399"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1399">--Are we likely to be asked questions on applied science?</p></div><div id="container-1400"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1400">The professor began to juggle gravely with the terms pure science and applied science. A heavy-built student, wearing gold spectacles, stared with some wonder at the questioner. Moynihan murmured from behind in his natural voice:</p></div><div id="container-1401"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1401">--Isn't MacAlister a devil for his pound of flesh?</p></div><div id="container-1402"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1402">Stephen looked coldly on the oblong skull beneath him overgrown with tangled twine-coloured hair. The voice, the accent, the mind of the questioner offended him and he allowed the offence to carry him towards wilful unkindness, bidding his mind think that the student's father would have done better had he sent his son to Belfast to study and have saved something on the train fare by so doing.</p></div><div id="container-1403"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1403">The oblong skull beneath did not turn to meet this shaft of thought and yet the shaft came back to its bowstring; for he saw in a moment the student's whey-pale face.</p></div><div id="container-1404"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1404">--That thought is not mine, he said to himself quickly. It came from the comic Irishman in the bench behind. Patience. Can you say with certitude by whom the soul of your race was bartered and its elect betrayed--by the questioner or by the mocker? Patience. Remember Epictetus. It is probably in his character to ask such a question at such a moment in such a tone and to pronounce the word SCIENCE as a monosyllable.</p></div><div id="container-1405"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1405">The droning voice of the professor continued to wind itself slowly round and round the coils it spoke of, doubling, trebling, quadrupling its somnolent energy as the coil multiplied its ohms of resistance.</p></div><div id="container-1406"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1406">Moynihan's voice called from behind in echo to a distant bell:</p></div><div id="container-1407"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1407">--Closing time, gents!</p></div><div id="container-1408"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1408">The entrance hall was crowded and loud with talk. On a table near the door were two photographs in frames and between them a long roll of paper bearing an irregular tail of signatures. MacCann went briskly to and fro among the students, talking rapidly, answering rebuffs and leading one after another to the table.

The heavy lumpish phrase sank slowly out of hearing like a stone through a quagmire. Stephen saw it sink as he had seen many another, feeling its heaviness depress his heart. Cranly's speech, unlike that of Davin, had neither rare phrases of Elizabethan English nor quaintly turned versions of Irish idioms. Its drawl was an echo of the quays of Dublin given back by a bleak decaying seaport, its energy an echo of the sacred eloquence of Dublin given back flatly by a Wicklow pulpit.</p></div><div id="container-1436"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1436">The heavy scowl faded from Cranly's face as MacCann marched briskly towards them from the other side of the hall.</p></div><div id="container-1437"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1437">--Here you are! said MacCann cheerily.</p></div><div id="container-1438"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1438">--Here I am! said Stephen.</p></div><div id="container-1439"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1439">--Late as usual.

A little ring of listeners closed round to hear the war of wits. A lean student with olive skin and lank black hair thrust his face between the two, glancing from one to the other at each phrase and seeming to try to catch each flying phrase in his open moist mouth. Cranly took a small grey handball from his pocket and began to examine it closely, turning it over and over.</p></div><div id="container-1442"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1442">--Next business? said MacCann.

He stood at the foot of the staircase, a foot on the lowest step, his threadbare soutane gathered about him for the ascent with womanish care, nodding his head often and repeating:</p></div><div id="container-1497"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1497">--Not a doubt of it, Mr Hackett!

Eh?</p></div><div id="container-1502"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1502">His whisper trailed off into sly cackling laughter. The moment they were through the doorway Cranly seized him rudely by the neck and shook him, saying:</p></div><div id="container-1503"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1503">--You flaming floundering fool!

The president, wrapped in a heavy loose cloak, was coming towards them along one of the walks, reading his office. At the end of the walk he halted before turning and raised his eyes. The students saluted, Temple fumbling as before at the peak of his cap. They walked forward in silence. As they neared the alley Stephen could hear the thuds of the players' hands and the wet smacks of the ball and Davin's voice crying out excitedly at each stroke.</p></div><div id="container-1507"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1507">The three students halted round the box on which Davin sat to follow the game.

Cranly, picking up the broken stave of a cask from the grass at his feet, turned swiftly and said sternly:</p></div><div id="container-1510"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1510">--Temple, I declare to the living God if you say another word, do you know, to anybody on any subject, I'll kill you SUPER SPOTTUM.</p></div><div id="container-1511"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1511">--He was like you, I fancy, said Stephen, an emotional man.</p></div><div id="container-1512"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1512">--Blast him, curse him! said Cranly broadly.

For God's sake, go home.</p></div><div id="container-1513"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1513">--I don't care a damn about you, Cranly, answered Temple, moving out of reach of the uplifted stave and pointing at Stephen.

Did you ever see such a go-by-the-wall?</p></div><div id="container-1518"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1518">His phrase was greeted by a strange laugh from a student who lounged against the wall, his peaked cap down on his eyes. The laugh, pitched in a high key and coming from a so muscular frame, seemed like the whinny of an elephant. The student's body shook all over and, to ease his mirth, he rubbed both his hands delightedly over his groins.</p></div><div id="container-1519"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1519">--Lynch is awake, said Cranly.</p></div><div id="container-1520"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1520">Lynch, for answer, straightened himself and thrust forward his chest.</p></div><div id="container-1521"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1521">--Lynch puts out his chest, said Stephen, as a criticism of life.</p></div><div id="container-1522"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1522">Lynch smote himself sonorously on the chest and said:</p></div><div id="container-1523"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1523">--Who has anything to say about my girth?</p></div><div id="container-1524"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1524">Cranly took him at the word and the two began to tussle.

The first morning we met you asked me to show you the way to the matriculation class, putting a very strong stress on the first syllable. You remember?

Why did you tell me those things?</p></div><div id="container-1544"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1544">--Thanks, said Stephen.

It has a slow and dark birth, more mysterious than the birth of the body. When the soul of a man is born in this country there are nets flung at it to hold it back from flight.

But in a moment his sadness left him and he was hotly disputing with Cranly and the two players who had finished their game. A match of four was arranged, Cranly insisting, however, that his ball should be used. He let it rebound twice or thrice to his hand and struck it strongly and swiftly towards the base of the alley, exclaiming in answer to its thud:</p></div><div id="container-1559"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1559">--Your soul!</p></div><div id="container-1560"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1560">Stephen stood with Lynch till the score began to rise.

I have. I say--</p></div><div id="container-1570"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1570">Lynch halted and said bluntly:</p></div><div id="container-1571"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1571">--Stop! I won't listen! I am sick. I was out last night on a yellow drunk with Horan and Goggins.</p></div><div id="container-1572"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1572">Stephen went on:</p></div><div id="container-1573"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1573">--Pity is the feeling which arrests the mind in the presence of whatsoever is grave and constant in human sufferings and unites it with the human sufferer. Terror is the feeling which arrests the mind in the presence of whatsoever is grave and constant in human sufferings and unites it with the secret cause.</p></div><div id="container-1574"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1574">--Repeat, said Lynch.</p></div><div id="container-1575"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1575">Stephen repeated the definitions slowly.</p></div><div id="container-1576"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1576">--A girl got into a hansom a few days ago, he went on, in London. She was on her way to meet her mother whom she had not seen for many years. At the corner of a street the shaft of a lorry shivered the window of the hansom in the shape of a star. A long fine needle of the shivered glass pierced her heart. She died on the instant. The reporter called it a tragic death. It is not. It is remote from terror and pity according to the terms of my definitions.</p></div><div id="container-1577"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1577">--The tragic emotion, in fact, is a face looking two ways, towards terror and towards pity, both of which are phases of it. You see I use the word ARREST. I mean that the tragic emotion is static. Or rather the dramatic emotion is. The feelings excited by improper art are kinetic, desire or loathing. Desire urges us to possess, to go to something; loathing urges us to abandon, to go from something. The arts which excite them, pornographical or didactic, are therefore improper arts. The esthetic emotion (I used the general term) is therefore static. The mind is arrested and raised above desire and loathing.</p></div><div id="container-1578"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1578">--You say that art must not excite desire, said Lynch. I told you that one day I wrote my name in pencil on the backside of the Venus of Praxiteles in the Museum. Was that not desire?</p></div><div id="container-1579"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1579">--I speak of normal natures, said Stephen. You also told me that when you were a boy in that charming carmelite school you ate pieces of dried cowdung.</p></div><div id="container-1580"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1580">Lynch broke again into a whinny of laughter and again rubbed both his hands over his groins but without taking them from his pockets.</p></div><div id="container-1581"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1581">--O, I did! I did! he cried.</p></div><div id="container-1582"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1582">Stephen turned towards his companion and looked at him for a moment boldly in the eyes. Lynch, recovering from his laughter, answered his look from his humbled eyes. The long slender flattened skull beneath the long pointed cap brought before Stephen's mind the image of a hooded reptile. The eyes, too, were reptile-like in glint and gaze. Yet at that instant, humbled and alert in their look, they were lit by one tiny human point, the window of a shrivelled soul, poignant and self-embittered.</p></div><div id="container-1583"><ul chunktype="poetry" class="poetry" id="chunk-1583"><li class="poetry-line" id="chunk-1583-line-1">--As for that, Stephen said in polite parenthesis, we are all animals.</li><li class="poetry-line" id="chunk-1583-line-2">I also am an animal.</li></ul></div><div id="container-1584"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1584">--You are, said Lynch.</p></div><div id="container-1585"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1585">--But we are just now in a mental world, Stephen continued. The desire and loathing excited by improper esthetic means are really not esthetic emotions not only because they are kinetic in character but also because they are not more than physical. Our flesh shrinks from what it dreads and responds to the stimulus of what it desires by a purely reflex action of the nervous system. Our eyelid closes before we are aware that the fly is about to enter our eye.</p></div><div id="container-1586"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1586">--Not always, said Lynch critically.</p></div><div id="container-1587"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1587">--In the same way, said Stephen, your flesh responded to the stimulus of a naked statue, but it was, I say, simply a reflex action of the nerves. Beauty expressed by the artist cannot awaken in us an emotion which is kinetic or a sensation which is purely physical. It awakens, or ought to awaken, or induces, or ought to induce, an esthetic stasis, an ideal pity or an ideal terror, a stasis called forth, prolonged, and at last dissolved by what I call the rhythm of beauty.</p></div><div id="container-1588"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1588">--What is that exactly? asked Lynch.</p></div><div id="container-1589"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1589">--Rhythm, said Stephen, is the first formal esthetic relation of part to part in any esthetic whole or of an esthetic whole to its part or parts or of any part to the esthetic whole of which it is a part.</p></div><div id="container-1590"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1590">--If that is rhythm, said Lynch, let me hear what you call beauty; and, please remember, though I did eat a cake of cowdung once, that I admire only beauty.</p></div><div id="container-1591"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1591">Stephen raised his cap as if in greeting. Then, blushing slightly, he laid his hand on Lynch's thick tweed sleeve.</p></div><div id="container-1592"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1592">--We are right, he said, and the others are wrong. To speak of these things and to try to understand their nature and, having understood it, to try slowly and humbly and constantly to express, to press out again, from the gross earth or what it brings forth, from sound and shape and colour which are the prison gates of our soul, an image of the beauty we have come to understand--that is art.</p></div><div id="container-1593"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1593">They had reached the canal bridge and, turning from their course, went on by the trees. A crude grey light, mirrored in the sluggish water and a smell of wet branches over their heads seemed to war against the course of Stephen's thought.</p></div><div id="container-1594"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1594">--But you have not answered my question, said Lynch. What is art? What is the beauty it expresses?</p></div><div id="container-1595"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1595">--That was the first definition I gave you, you sleepy-headed wretch, said Stephen, when I began to try to think out the matter for myself. Do you remember the night? Cranly lost his temper and began to talk about Wicklow bacon.</p></div><div id="container-1596"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1596">--I remember, said Lynch. He told us about them flaming fat devils of pigs.</p></div><div id="container-1597"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1597">--Art, said Stephen, is the human disposition of sensible or intelligible matter for an esthetic end. You remember the pigs and forget that. You are a distressing pair, you and Cranly.</p></div><div id="container-1598"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1598">Lynch made a grimace at the raw grey sky and said:</p></div><div id="container-1599"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1599">--If I am to listen to your esthetic philosophy give me at least another cigarette. I don't care about it. I don't even care about women. Damn you and damn everything. I want a job of five hundred a year. You can't get me one.</p></div><div id="container-1600"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1600">Stephen handed him the packet of cigarettes. Lynch took the last one that remained, saying simply:</p></div><div id="container-1601"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1601">--Proceed!</p></div><div id="container-1602"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1602">--Aquinas, said Stephen, says that is beautiful the apprehension of which pleases.</p></div><div id="container-1603"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1603">Lynch nodded.</p></div><div id="container-1604"><p chunktype="misc" class="misc" id="chunk-1604">--I remember that, he said, PULCRA SUNT QUAE VISA PLACENT.</p></div><div id="container-1605"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1605">--He uses the word VISA, said Stephen, to cover esthetic apprehensions of all kinds, whether through sight or hearing or through any other avenue of apprehension. This word, though it is vague, is clear enough to keep away good and evil which excite desire and loathing. It means certainly a stasis and not a kinesis. How about the true? It produces also a stasis of the mind. You would not write your name in pencil across the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle.</p></div><div id="container-1606"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1606">--No, said Lynch, give me the hypotenuse of the Venus of Praxiteles.</p></div><div id="container-1607"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1607">--Static therefore, said Stephen. Plato, I believe, said that beauty is the splendour of truth. I don't think that it has a meaning, but the true and the beautiful are akin. Truth is beheld by the intellect which is appeased by the most satisfying relations of the intelligible; beauty is beheld by the imagination which is appeased by the most satisfying relations of the sensible. The first step in the direction of truth is to understand the frame and scope of the intellect itself, to comprehend the act itself of intellection. Aristotle's entire system of philosophy rests upon his book of psychology and that, I think, rests on his statement that the same attribute cannot at the same time and in the same connexion belong to and not belong to the same subject. The first step in the direction of beauty is to understand the frame and scope of the imagination, to comprehend the act itself of esthetic apprehension. Is that clear?</p></div><div id="container-1608"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1608">--But what is beauty? asked Lynch impatiently. Out with another definition. Something we see and like! Is that the best you and Aquinas can do?</p></div><div id="container-1609"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1609">--Let us take woman, said Stephen.</p></div><div id="container-1610"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1610">--Let us take her! said Lynch fervently.</p></div><div id="container-1611"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1611">--The Greek, the Turk, the Chinese, the Copt, the Hottentot, said Stephen, all admire a different type of female beauty. That seems to be a maze out of which we cannot escape. I see, however, two ways out. One is this hypothesis: that every physical quality admired by men in women is in direct connexion with the manifold functions of women for the propagation of the species. It may be so. The world, it seems, is drearier than even you, Lynch, imagined. For my part I dislike that way out. It leads to eugenics rather than to esthetic. It leads you out of the maze into a new gaudy lecture-room where MacCann, with one hand on THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES and the other hand on the new testament, tells you that you admired the great flanks of Venus because you felt that she would bear you burly offspring and admired her great breasts because you felt that she would give good milk to her children and yours.</p></div><div id="container-1612"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1612">--Then MacCann is a sulphur-yellow liar, said Lynch energetically.</p></div><div id="container-1613"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1613">--There remains another way out, said Stephen, laughing.</p></div><div id="container-1614"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1614">--To wit? said Lynch.</p></div><div id="container-1615"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1615">--This hypothesis, Stephen began.</p></div><div id="container-1616"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1616">A long dray laden with old iron came round the corner of Sir Patrick Dun's hospital covering the end of Stephen's speech with the harsh roar of jangled and rattling metal. Lynch closed his ears and gave out oath after oath till the dray had passed. Then he turned on his heel rudely. Stephen turned also and waited for a few moments till his companion's ill-humour had had its vent.</p></div><div id="container-1617"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1617">--This hypothesis, Stephen repeated, is the other way out: that, though the same object may not seem beautiful to all people, all people who admire a beautiful object find in it certain relations which satisfy and coincide with the stages themselves of all esthetic apprehension. These relations of the sensible, visible to you through one form and to me through another, must be therefore the necessary qualities of beauty. Now, we can return to our old friend saint Thomas for another pennyworth of wisdom.</p></div><div id="container-1618"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1618">Lynch laughed.</p></div><div id="container-1619"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1619">--It amuses me vastly, he said, to hear you quoting him time after time like a jolly round friar. Are you laughing in your sleeve?</p></div><div id="container-1620"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1620">--MacAlister, answered Stephen, would call my esthetic theory applied Aquinas. So far as this side of esthetic philosophy extends, Aquinas will carry me all along the line. When we come to the phenomena of artistic conception, artistic gestation, and artistic reproduction I require a new terminology and a new personal experience.</p></div><div id="container-1621"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1621">--Of course, said Lynch. After all Aquinas, in spite of his intellect, was exactly a good round friar. But you will tell me about the new personal experience and new terminology some other day. Hurry up and finish the first part.</p></div><div id="container-1622"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1622">--Who knows? said Stephen, smiling. Perhaps Aquinas would understand me better than you. He was a poet himself. He wrote a hymn for Maundy Thursday. It begins with the words PANGE LINGUA GLORIOSI. They say it is the highest glory of the hymnal. It is an intricate and soothing hymn. I like it; but there is no hymn that can be put beside that mournful and majestic processional song, the VEXILLA REGIS of Venantius Fortunatus.</p></div><div id="container-1623"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1623">Lynch began to sing softly and solemnly in a deep bass voice:</p></div><div id="container-1624"><p chunktype="misc" class="misc" id="chunk-1624">IMPLETA SUNT QUAE CONCINIT DAVID FIDELI CARMINE DICENDO NATIONIBUS REGNAVIT A LIGNO DEUS.</p></div><div id="container-1625"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1625">--That's great! he said, well pleased.

If you think I have an excrementitious intelligence run after Donovan and ask him to listen to you.</p></div><div id="container-1649"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1649">Stephen pointed to a basket which a butcher's boy had slung inverted on his head.</p></div><div id="container-1650"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1650">--Look at that basket, he said.</p></div><div id="container-1651"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1651">--I see it, said Lynch.</p></div><div id="container-1652"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1652">--In order to see that basket, said Stephen, your mind first of all separates the basket from the rest of the visible universe which is not the basket. The first phase of apprehension is a bounding line drawn about the object to be apprehended. An esthetic image is presented to us either in space or in time.</p></div><div id="container-1653"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1653">What is audible is presented in time, what is visible is presented in space. But, temporal or spatial, the esthetic image is first luminously apprehended as selfbounded and selfcontained upon the immeasurable background of space or time which is not it. You apprehended it as ONE thing. You see it as one whole. You apprehend its wholeness. That is INTEGRITAS.</p></div><div id="container-1654"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1654">--Bull's eye! said Lynch, laughing. Go on.</p></div><div id="container-1655"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1655">--Then, said Stephen, you pass from point to point, led by its formal lines; you apprehend it as balanced part against part within its limits; you feel the rhythm of its structure. In other words, the synthesis of immediate perception is followed by the analysis of apprehension. Having first felt that it is ONE thing you feel now that it is a THING. You apprehend it as complex, multiple, divisible, separable, made up of its parts, the result of its parts and their sum, harmonious. That is CONSONANTIA.</p></div><div id="container-1656"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1656">--Bull's eye again! said Lynch wittily. Tell me now what is CLARITAS and you win the cigar.</p></div><div id="container-1657"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1657">--The connotation of the word, Stephen said, is rather vague. Aquinas uses a term which seems to be inexact. It baffled me for a long time. It would lead you to believe that he had in mind symbolism or idealism, the supreme quality of beauty being a light from some other world, the idea of which the matter is but the shadow, the reality of which it is but the symbol. I thought he might mean that CLARITAS is the artistic discovery and representation of the divine purpose in anything or a force of generalization which would make the esthetic image a universal one, make it outshine its proper conditions. But that is literary talk. I understand it so. When you have apprehended that basket as one thing and have then analysed it according to its form and apprehended it as a thing you make the only synthesis which is logically and esthetically permissible. You see that it is that thing which it is and no other thing. The radiance of which he speaks in the scholastic QUIDDITAS, the WHATNESS of a thing. This supreme quality is felt by the artist when the esthetic image is first conceived in his imagination. The mind in that mysterious instant Shelley likened beautifully to a fading coal. The instant wherein that supreme quality of beauty, the clear radiance of the esthetic image, is apprehended luminously by the mind which has been arrested by its wholeness and fascinated by its harmony is the luminous silent stasis of esthetic pleasure, a spiritual state very like to that cardiac condition which the Italian physiologist Luigi Galvani, using a phrase almost as beautiful as Shelley's, called the enchantment of the heart.</p></div><div id="container-1658"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1658">Stephen paused and, though his companion did not speak, felt that his words had called up around them a thought-enchanted silence.</p></div><div id="container-1659"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1659">--What I have said, he began again, refers to beauty in the wider sense of the word, in the sense which the word has in the literary tradition. In the marketplace it has another sense. When we speak of beauty in the second sense of the term our judgement is influenced in the first place by the art itself and by the form of that art. The image, it is clear, must be set between the mind or senses of the artist himself and the mind or senses of others. If you bear this in memory you will see that art necessarily divides itself into three forms progressing from one to the next. These forms are: the lyrical form, the form wherein the artist presents his image in immediate relation to himself; the epical form, the form wherein he presents his image in mediate relation to himself and to others; the dramatic form, the form wherein he presents his image in immediate relation to others.</p></div><div id="container-1660"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1660">--That you told me a few nights ago, said Lynch, and we began the famous discussion.</p></div><div id="container-1661"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1661">--I have a book at home, said Stephen, in which I have written down questions which are more amusing than yours were. In finding the answers to them I found the theory of esthetic which I am trying to explain. Here are some questions I set myself: IS A CHAIR FINELY MADE TRAGIC OR COMIC? IS THE PORTRAIT OF MONA LISA GOOD IF I DESIRE TO SEE IT? IF NOT, WHY NOT?</p></div><div id="container-1662"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1662">--Why not, indeed? said Lynch, laughing.</p></div><div id="container-1663"><p chunktype="misc" class="misc" id="chunk-1663">--IF A MAN HACKING IN FURY AT A BLOCK OF WOOD, Stephen continued, MAKE THERE AN IMAGE OF A COW, IS THAT IMAGE A WORK OF ART? IF NOT, WHY NOT?</p></div><div id="container-1664"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1664">--That's a lovely one, said Lynch, laughing again. That has the true scholastic stink.</p></div><div id="container-1665"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1665">--Lessing, said Stephen, should not have taken a group of statues to write of. The art, being inferior, does not present the forms I spoke of distinguished clearly one from another. Even in literature, the highest and most spiritual art, the forms are often confused. The lyrical form is in fact the simplest verbal vesture of an instant of emotion, a rhythmical cry such as ages ago cheered on the man who pulled at the oar or dragged stones up a slope. He who utters it is more conscious of the instant of emotion than of himself as feeling emotion. The simplest epical form is seen emerging out of lyrical literature when the artist prolongs and broods upon himself as the centre of an epical event and this form progresses till the centre of emotional gravity is equidistant from the artist himself and from others. The narrative is no longer purely personal. The personality of the artist passes into the narration itself, flowing round and round the persons and the action like a vital sea. This progress you will see easily in that old English ballad TURPIN HERO which begins in the first person and ends in the third person. The dramatic form is reached when the vitality which has flowed and eddied round each person fills every person with such vital force that he or she assumes a proper and intangible esthetic life. The personality of the artist, at first a cry or a cadence or a mood and then a fluid and lambent narrative, finally refines itself out of existence, impersonalizes itself, so to speak. The esthetic image in the dramatic form is life purified in and reprojected from the human imagination. The mystery of esthetic, like that of material creation, is accomplished. The artist, like the God of creation, remains within or behind or beyond or above his handiwork, invisible, refined out of existence, indifferent, paring his fingernails.</p></div><div id="container-1666"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1666">--Trying to refine them also out of existence, said Lynch.</p></div><div id="container-1667"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1667">A fine rain began to fall from the high veiled sky and they turned into the duke's lawn to reach the national library before the shower came.</p></div><div id="container-1668"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1668">--What do you mean, Lynch asked surlily, by prating about beauty and the imagination in this miserable Godforsaken island?

When they passed through the passage beside Kildare house they found many students sheltering under the arcade of the library. Cranly, leaning against a pillar, was picking his teeth with a sharpened match, listening to some companions. Some girls stood near the entrance door. Lynch whispered to Stephen:</p></div><div id="container-1670"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1670">--Your beloved is here.</p></div><div id="container-1671"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1671">Stephen took his place silently on the step below the group of students, heedless of the rain which fell fast, turning his eyes towards her from time to time. She too stood silently among her companions. She has no priest to flirt with, he thought with conscious bitterness, remembering how he had seen her last. Lynch was right. His mind emptied of theory and courage, lapsed back into a listless peace.</p></div><div id="container-1672"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1672">He heard the students talking among themselves.

O what sweet music! His soul was all dewy wet. Over his limbs in sleep pale cool waves of light had passed. He lay still, as if his soul lay amid cool waters, conscious of faint sweet music. His mind was waking slowly to a tremulous morning knowledge, a morning inspiration. A spirit filled him, pure as the purest water, sweet as dew, moving as music. But how faintly it was inbreathed, how passionlessly, as if the seraphim themselves were breathing upon him! His soul was waking slowly, fearing to awake wholly. It was that windless hour of dawn when madness wakes and strange plants open to the light and the moth flies forth silently.</p></div><div id="container-1685"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1685">An enchantment of the heart!

The instant flashed forth like a point of light and now from cloud on cloud of vague circumstance confused form was veiling softly its afterglow. O! In the virgin womb of the imagination the word was made flesh. Gabriel the seraph had come to the virgin's chamber. An afterglow deepened within his spirit, whence the white flame had passed, deepening to a rose and ardent light. That rose and ardent light was her strange wilful heart, strange that no man had known or would know, wilful from before the beginning of the world; and lured by that ardent rose-like glow the choirs of the seraphim were falling from heaven.</p></div><div id="container-1687"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1687">Are you not weary of ardent ways, Lure of the fallen seraphim?

The heart's cry was broken.</p></div><div id="container-1693"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1693">The veiled windless hour had passed and behind the panes of the naked window the morning light was gathering. A bell beat faintly very far away. A bird twittered; two birds, three.

There was neither on the table; only the soup plate he had eaten the rice from for supper and the candlestick with its tendrils of tallow and its paper socket, singed by the last flame. He stretched his arm wearily towards the foot of the bed, groping with his hand in the pockets of the coat that hung there. His fingers found a pencil and then a cigarette packet. He lay back and, tearing open the packet, placed the last cigarette on the window ledge and began to write out the stanzas of the villanelle in small neat letters on the rough cardboard surface.</p></div><div id="container-1695"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1695">Having written them out he lay back on the lumpy pillow, murmuring them again. The lumps of knotted flock under his head reminded him of the lumps of knotted horsehair in the sofa of her parlour on which he used to sit, smiling or serious, asking himself why he had come, displeased with her and with himself, confounded by the print of the Sacred Heart above the untenanted sideboard. He saw her approach him in a lull of the talk and beg him to sing one of his curious songs. Then he saw himself sitting at the old piano, striking chords softly from its speckled keys and singing, amid the talk which had risen again in the room, to her who leaned beside the mantelpiece a dainty song of the Elizabethans, a sad and sweet loth to depart, the victory chant of Agincourt, the happy air of Greensleeves. While he sang and she listened, or feigned to listen, his heart was at rest but when the quaint old songs had ended and he heard again the voices in the room he remembered his own sarcasm: the house where young men are called by their christian names a little too soon.</p></div><div id="container-1696"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1696">At certain instants her eyes seemed about to trust him but he had waited in vain. She passed now dancing lightly across his memory as she had been that night at the carnival ball, her white dress a little lifted, a white spray nodding in her hair. She danced lightly in the round. She was dancing towards him and, as she came, her eyes were a little averted and a faint glow was on her cheek. At the pause in the chain of hands her hand had lain in his an instant, a soft merchandise.</p></div><div id="container-1697"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1697">--You are a great stranger now.</p></div><div id="container-1698"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1698">--Yes.

It broke up violently her fair image and flung the fragments on all sides. On all sides distorted reflections of her image started from his memory: the flower girl in the ragged dress with damp coarse hair and a hoyden's face who had called herself his own girl and begged his handsel, the kitchen-girl in the next house who sang over the clatter of her plates, with the drawl of a country singer, the first bars of BY KILLARNEY'S LAKES AND FELLS, a girl who had laughed gaily to see him stumble when the iron grating in the footpath near Cork Hill had caught the broken sole of his shoe, a girl he had glanced at, attracted by her small ripe mouth, as she passed out of Jacob's biscuit factory, who had cried to him over her shoulder:</p></div><div id="container-1709"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1709">--Do you like what you seen of me, straight hair and curly eyebrows?</p></div><div id="container-1710"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1710">And yet he felt that, however he might revile and mock her image, his anger was also a form of homage. He had left the classroom in disdain that was not wholly sincere, feeling that perhaps the secret of her race lay behind those dark eyes upon which her long lashes flung a quick shadow. He had told himself bitterly as he walked through the streets that she was a figure of the womanhood of her country, a bat-like soul waking to the consciousness of itself in darkness and secrecy and loneliness, tarrying awhile, loveless and sinless, with her mild lover and leaving him to whisper of innocent transgressions in the latticed ear of a priest. His anger against her found vent in coarse railing at her paramour, whose name and voice and features offended his baffled pride: a priested peasant, with a brother a policeman in Dublin and a brother a potboy in Moycullen. To him she would unveil her soul's shy nakedness, to one who was but schooled in the discharging of a formal rite rather than to him, a priest of the eternal imagination, transmuting the daily bread of experience into the radiant body of everliving life.</p></div><div id="container-1711"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1711">The radiant image of the eucharist united again in an instant his bitter and despairing thoughts, their cries arising unbroken in a hymn of thanksgiving.</p></div><div id="container-1712"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1712">Our broken cries and mournful lays Rise in one eucharistic hymn Are you not weary of ardent ways?</p></div><div id="container-1713"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1713">While sacrificing hands upraise The chalice flowing to the brim.

The air of the late March evening made clear their flight, their dark quivering bodies flying clearly against the sky as against a limp-hung cloth of smoky tenuous blue.</p></div><div id="container-1731"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1731">He watched their flight; bird after bird: a dark flash, a swerve, a flutter of wings. He tried to count them before all their darting quivering bodies passed: six, ten, eleven: and wondered were they odd or even in number. Twelve, thirteen: for two came wheeling down from the upper sky. They were flying high and low but ever round and round in straight and curving lines and ever flying from left to right, circling about a temple of air.</p></div><div id="container-1732"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1732">He listened to the cries: like the squeak of mice behind the wainscot: a shrill twofold note. But the notes were long and shrill and whirring, unlike the cry of vermin, falling a third or a fourth and trilled as the flying beaks clove the air. Their cry was shrill and clear and fine and falling like threads of silken light unwound from whirring spools.</p></div><div id="container-1733"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1733">The inhuman clamour soothed his ears in which his mother's sobs and reproaches murmured insistently and the dark frail quivering bodies wheeling and fluttering and swerving round an airy temple of the tenuous sky soothed his eyes which still saw the image of his mother's face.</p></div><div id="container-1734"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1734">Why was he gazing upwards from the steps of the porch, hearing their shrill twofold cry, watching their flight? For an augury of good or evil? A phrase of Cornelius Agrippa flew through his mind and then there flew hither and thither shapeless thoughts from Swedenborg on the correspondence of birds to things of the intellect and of how the creatures of the air have their knowledge and know their times and seasons because they, unlike man, are in the order of their life and have not perverted that order by reason.</p></div><div id="container-1735"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1735">And for ages men had gazed upward as he was gazing at birds in flight. The colonnade above him made him think vaguely of an ancient temple and the ashplant on which he leaned wearily of the curved stick of an augur. A sense of fear of the unknown moved in the heart of his weariness, a fear of symbols and portents, of the hawk-like man whose name he bore soaring out of his captivity on osier-woven wings, of Thoth, the god of writers, writing with a reed upon a tablet and bearing on his narrow ibis head the cusped moon.</p></div><div id="container-1736"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1736">He smiled as he thought of the god's image for it made him think of a bottle-nosed judge in a wig, putting commas into a document which he held at arm's length, and he knew that he would not have remembered the god's name but that it was like an Irish oath. It was folly. But was it for this folly that he was about to leave for ever the house of prayer and prudence into which he had been born and the order of life out of which he had come?</p></div><div id="container-1737"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1737">They came back with shrill cries over the jutting shoulder of the house, flying darkly against the fading air. What birds were they? He thought that they must be swallows who had come back from the south. Then he was to go away for they were birds ever going and coming, building ever an unlasting home under the eaves of men's houses and ever leaving the homes they had built to wander.</p></div><div id="container-1738"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1738">Bend down your faces, Oona and Aleel.

The verses crooned in the ear of his memory composed slowly before his remembering eyes the scene of the hall on the night of the opening of the national theatre. He was alone at the side of the balcony, looking out of jaded eyes at the culture of Dublin in the stalls and at the tawdry scene-cloths and human dolls framed by the garish lamps of the stage. A burly policeman sweated behind him and seemed at every moment about to act.

A thick book, opened at the frontispiece, lay before him on the wooden rest. He leaned back in his chair, inclining his ear like that of a confessor to the face of the medical student who was reading to him a problem from the chess page of a journal. Stephen sat down at his right and the priest at the other side of the table closed his copy of THE TABLET with an angry snap and stood up.</p></div><div id="container-1751"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1751">Cranly gazed after him blandly and vaguely.

A game of swans flew there and the water and the shore beneath were fouled with their green-white slime. They embraced softly, impelled by the grey rainy light, the wet silent trees, the shield-like witnessing lake, the swans. They embraced without joy or passion, his arm about his sister's neck. A grey woollen cloak was wrapped athwart her from her shoulder to her waist and her fair head was bent in willing shame. He had loose red-brown hair and tender shapely strong freckled hands. Face? There was no face seen. The brother's face was bent upon her fair rain-fragrant hair.

That's the only English dual number. Did you know?</p></div><div id="container-1832"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1832">--Is it? Stephen said vaguely.</p></div><div id="container-1833"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1833">He was watching Cranly's firm-featured suffering face, lit up now by a smile of false patience. The gross name had passed over it like foul water poured over an old stone image, patient of injuries; and, as he watched him, he saw him raise his hat in salute and uncover the black hair that stood stiffly from his forehead like an iron crown.</p></div><div id="container-1834"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1834">She passed out from the porch of the library and bowed across Stephen in reply to Cranly's greeting.

He could not see.</p></div><div id="container-1835"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1835">Did that explain his friend's listless silence, his harsh comments, the sudden intrusions of rude speech with which he had shattered so often Stephen's ardent wayward confessions? Stephen had forgiven freely for he had found this rudeness also in himself. And he remembered an evening when he had dismounted from a borrowed creaking bicycle to pray to God in a wood near Malahide. He had lifted up his arms and spoken in ecstasy to the sombre nave of the trees, knowing that he stood on holy ground and in a holy hour. And when two constabulary men had come into sight round a bend in the gloomy road he had broken off his prayer to whistle loudly an air from the last pantomime.</p></div><div id="container-1836"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1836">He began to beat the frayed end of his ashplant against the base of a pillar. Had Cranly not heard him? Yet he could wait. The talk about him ceased for a moment and a soft hiss fell again from a window above. But no other sound was in the air and the swallows whose flight he had followed with idle eyes were sleeping.</p></div><div id="container-1837"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1837">She had passed through the dusk. And therefore the air was silent save for one soft hiss that fell. And therefore the tongues about him had ceased their babble. Darkness was falling.</p></div><div id="container-1838"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1838">Darkness falls from the air.</p></div><div id="container-1839"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1839">A trembling joy, lambent as a faint light, played like a fairy host around him. But why? Her passage through the darkening air or the verse with its black vowels and its opening sound, rich and lutelike?</p></div><div id="container-1840"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1840">He walked away slowly towards the deeper shadows at the end of the colonnade, beating the stone softly with his stick to hide his revery from the students whom he had left: and allowed his mind to summon back to itself the age of Dowland and Byrd and Nash.</p></div><div id="container-1841"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1841">Eyes, opening from the darkness of desire, eyes that dimmed the breaking east. What was their languid grace but the softness of chambering? And what was their shimmer but the shimmer of the scum that mantled the cesspool of the court of a slobbering Stuart. And he tasted in the language of memory ambered wines, dying fallings of sweet airs, the proud pavan, and saw with the eyes of memory kind gentlewomen in Covent Garden wooing from their balconies with sucking mouths and the pox-fouled wenches of the taverns and young wives that, gaily yielding to their ravishers, clipped and clipped again.</p></div><div id="container-1842"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1842">The images he had summoned gave him no pleasure. They were secret and inflaming but her image was not entangled by them. That was not the way to think of her. It was not even the way in which he thought of her. Could his mind then not trust itself? Old phrases, sweet only with a disinterred sweetness like the figseeds Cranly rooted out of his gleaming teeth.</p></div><div id="container-1843"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1843">It was not thought nor vision though he knew vaguely that her figure was passing homeward through the city. Vaguely first and then more sharply he smelt her body. A conscious unrest seethed in his blood. Yes, it was her body he smelt, a wild and languid smell, the tepid limbs over which his music had flowed desirously and the secret soft linen upon which her flesh distilled odour and a dew.</p></div><div id="container-1844"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1844">A louse crawled over the nape of his neck and, putting his thumb and forefinger deftly beneath his loose collar, he caught it. He rolled its body, tender yet brittle as a grain of rice, between thumb and finger for an instant before he let it fall from him and wondered would it live or die. There came to his mind a curious phrase from CORNELIUS A LAPIDE which said that the lice born of human sweat were not created by God with the other animals on the sixth day. But the tickling of the skin of his neck made his mind raw and red. The life of his body, ill clad, ill fed, louse-eaten, made him close his eyelids in a sudden spasm of despair and in the darkness he saw the brittle bright bodies of lice falling from the air and turning often as they fell. Yes, and it was not darkness that fell from the air. It was brightness.</p></div><div id="container-1845"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1845">Brightness falls from the air.</p></div><div id="container-1846"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1846">He had not even remembered rightly Nash's line.

Temple sat on the pediment of a pillar, leaning back, his cap pulled down on his sleepy eyes. A squat young man came out of the porch, a leather portfolio tucked under his armpit. He marched towards the group, striking the flags with the heels of his boots and with the ferrule of his heavy umbrella. Then, raising the umbrella in salute, he said to all:</p></div><div id="container-1849"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1849">--Good evening, sirs.</p></div><div id="container-1850"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1850">He struck the flags again and tittered while his head trembled with a slight nervous movement.

Cranly cried, clapping his hands.</p></div><div id="container-1897"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1897">--Neither my arse nor my elbow! Temple cried out scornfully. And that's what I call limbo.</p></div><div id="container-1898"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1898">--Give us that stick here, Cranly said.</p></div><div id="container-1899"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1899">He snatched the ashplant roughly from Stephen's hand and sprang down the steps: but Temple, hearing him move in pursuit, fled through the dusk like a wild creature, nimble and fleet-footed. Cranly's heavy boots were heard loudly charging across the quadrangle and then returning heavily, foiled and spurning the gravel at each step.</p></div><div id="container-1900"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1900">His step was angry and with an angry abrupt gesture he thrust the stick back into Stephen's hand. Stephen felt that his anger had another cause but, feigning patience, touched his arm slightly and said quietly:</p></div><div id="container-1901"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1901">--Cranly, I told you I wanted to speak to you. Come away.</p></div><div id="container-1902"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1902">Cranly looked at him for a few moments and asked:</p></div><div id="container-1903"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1903">--Now?</p></div><div id="container-1904"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1904">--Yes, now, Stephen said. We can't speak here. Come away.</p></div><div id="container-1905"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1905">They crossed the quadrangle together without speaking. The bird call from SIEGFRIED whistled softly followed them from the steps of the porch. Cranly turned, and Dixon, who had whistled, called out:</p></div><div id="container-1906"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1906">--Where are you fellows off to? What about that game, Cranly?</p></div><div id="container-1907"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1907">They parleyed in shouts across the still air about a game of billiards to be played in the Adelphi hotel. Stephen walked on alone and out into the quiet of Kildare Street opposite Maple's hotel he stood to wait, patient again. The name of the hotel, a colourless polished wood, and its colourless front stung him like a glance of polite disdain. He stared angrily back at the softly lit drawing-room of the hotel in which he imagined the sleek lives of the patricians of Ireland housed in calm. They thought of army commissions and land agents: peasants greeted them along the roads in the country; they knew the names of certain French dishes and gave orders to jarvies in high-pitched provincial voices which pierced through their skin-tight accents.</p></div><div id="container-1908"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1908">How could he hit their conscience or how cast his shadow over the imaginations of their daughters, before their squires begat upon them, that they might breed a race less ignoble than their own? And under the deepened dusk he felt the thoughts and desires of the race to which he belonged flitting like bats across the dark country lanes, under trees by the edges of streams and near the pool-mottled bogs. A woman had waited in the doorway as Davin had passed by at night and, offering him a cup of milk, had all but wooed him to her bed; for Davin had the mild eyes of one who could be secret. But him no woman's eyes had wooed.</p></div><div id="container-1909"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1909">His arm was taken in a strong grip and Cranly's voice said:</p></div><div id="container-1910"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1910">--Let us eke go.</p></div><div id="container-1911"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1911">They walked southward in silence. Then Cranly said:</p></div><div id="container-1912"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1912">--That blithering idiot, Temple! I swear to Moses, do you know, that I'll be the death of that fellow one time.</p></div><div id="container-1913"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1913">But his voice was no longer angry and Stephen wondered was he thinking of her greeting to him under the porch.</p></div><div id="container-1914"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1914">They turned to the left and walked on as before. When they had gone on so for some time Stephen said:</p></div><div id="container-1915"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1915">--Cranly, I had an unpleasant quarrel this evening.</p></div><div id="container-1916"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1916">--With your people?

You're an excitable bloody man, do you know.</p></div><div id="container-1931"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1931">He laughed nervously as he spoke and, looking up into Stephen's face with moved and friendly eyes, said:</p></div><div id="container-1932"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1932">--Do you know that you are an excitable man?</p></div><div id="container-1933"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1933">--I daresay I am, said Stephen, laughing also.</p></div><div id="container-1934"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1934">Their minds, lately estranged, seemed suddenly to have been drawn closer, one to the other.</p></div><div id="container-1935"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1935">--Do you believe in the eucharist?

You cannot discuss this question with your mouth full of chewed fig.</p></div><div id="container-1943"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1943">Cranly examined the fig by the light of a lamp under which he halted. Then he smelt it with both nostrils, bit a tiny piece, spat it out and threw the fig rudely into the gutter.</p></div><div id="container-1944"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1944">Addressing it as it lay, he said:</p></div><div id="container-1945"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1945">--Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire!</p></div><div id="container-1946"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1946">Taking Stephen's arms, he went on again and said:</p></div><div id="container-1947"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1947">--Do you not fear that those words may be spoken to you on the day of Judgement?</p></div><div id="container-1948"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1948">--What is offered me on the other hand?

Do as she wishes you to do. What is it for you? You disbelieve in it. It is a form: nothing else. And you will set her mind at rest.</p></div><div id="container-1985"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1985">He ceased and, as Stephen did not reply, remained silent. Then, as if giving utterance to the process of his own thought, he said:</p></div><div id="container-1986"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1986">--Whatever else is unsure in this stinking dunghill of a world a mother's love is not. Your mother brings you into the world, carries you first in her body. What do we know about what she feels? But whatever she feels, it, at least, must be real. It must be. What are our ideas or ambitions? Play. Ideas! Why, that bloody bleating goat Temple has ideas. MacCann has ideas too. Every jackass going the roads thinks he has ideas.</p></div><div id="container-1987"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1987">Stephen, who had been listening to the unspoken speech behind the words, said with assumed carelessness:</p></div><div id="container-1988"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1988">--Pascal, if I remember rightly, would not suffer his mother to kiss him as he feared the contact of her sex.</p></div><div id="container-1989"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1989">--Pascal was a pig, said Cranly.</p></div><div id="container-1990"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1990">--Aloysius Gonzaga, I think, was of the same mind, Stephen said.</p></div><div id="container-1991"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1991">--And he was another pig then, said Cranly.</p></div><div id="container-1992"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1992">--The church calls him a saint, Stephen objected.</p></div><div id="container-1993"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-1993">--I don't care a flaming damn what anyone calls him, Cranly said rudely and flatly.

And because you fear that it may be?</p></div><div id="container-2007"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2007">--Yes, Stephen said quietly, I feel that and I also fear it.</p></div><div id="container-2008"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2008">--I see, Cranly said.</p></div><div id="container-2009"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2009">Stephen, struck by his tone of closure, reopened the discussion at once by saying:</p></div><div id="container-2010"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2010">--I fear many things: dogs, horses, fire-arms, the sea, thunder-storms, machinery, the country roads at night.</p></div><div id="container-2011"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2011">--But why do you fear a bit of bread?</p></div><div id="container-2012"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2012">--I imagine, Stephen said, that there is a malevolent reality behind those things I say I fear.</p></div><div id="container-2013"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2013">--Do you fear then, Cranly asked, that the God of the Roman catholics would strike you dead and damn you if you made a sacrilegious communion?</p></div><div id="container-2014"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2014">--The God of the Roman catholics could do that now, Stephen said. I fear more than that the chemical action which would be set up in my soul by a false homage to a symbol behind which are massed twenty centuries of authority and veneration.</p></div><div id="container-2015"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2015">--Would you, Cranly asked, in extreme danger, commit that particular sacrilege? For instance, if you lived in the penal days?</p></div><div id="container-2016"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2016">--I cannot answer for the past, Stephen replied. Possibly not.</p></div><div id="container-2017"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2017">--Then, said Cranly, you do not intend to become a protestant?</p></div><div id="container-2018"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2018">--I said that I had lost the faith, Stephen answered, but not that I had lost self-respect.

The air of wealth and repose diffused about them seemed to comfort their neediness. Behind a hedge of laurel a light glimmered in the window of a kitchen and the voice of a servant was heard singing as she sharpened knives. She sang, in short broken bars:</p></div><div id="container-2020"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2020">Rosie O'Grady.</p></div><div id="container-2021"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2021">Cranly stopped to listen, saying:</p></div><div id="container-2022"><p chunktype="misc" class="misc" id="chunk-2022">--MULIER CANTAT.</p></div><div id="container-2023"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2023">The soft beauty of the Latin word touched with an enchanting touch the dark of the evening, with a touch fainter and more persuading than the touch of music or of a woman's hand. The strife of their minds was quelled. The figure of a woman as she appears in the liturgy of the church passed silently through the darkness: a white-robed figure, small and slender as a boy, and with a falling girdle. Her voice, frail and high as a boy's, was heard intoning from a distant choir the first words of a woman which pierce the gloom and clamour of the first chanting of the passion:</p></div><div id="container-2024"><p chunktype="misc" class="misc" id="chunk-2024">--ET TU CUM JESU GALILAEO ERAS.</p></div><div id="container-2025"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2025">And all hearts were touched and turned to her voice, shining like a young star, shining clearer as the voice intoned the proparoxytone and more faintly as the cadence died.</p></div><div id="container-2026"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2026">The singing ceased. They went on together, Cranly repeating in strongly stressed rhythm the end of the refrain:</p></div><div id="container-2027"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2027">And when we are married, O, how happy we'll be For I love sweet Rosie O'Grady And Rosie O'Grady loves me.</p></div><div id="container-2028"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2028">--There's real poetry for you, he said. There's real love.</p></div><div id="container-2029"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2029">He glanced sideways at Stephen with a strange smile and said:</p></div><div id="container-2030"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2030">--Do you consider that poetry? Or do you know what the words mean?</p></div><div id="container-2031"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2031">--I want to see Rosie first, said Stephen.</p></div><div id="container-2032"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2032">--She's easy to find, Cranly said.</p></div><div id="container-2033"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2033">His hat had come down on his forehead. He shoved it back and in the shadow of the trees Stephen saw his pale face, framed by the dark, and his large dark eyes. Yes. His face was handsome and his body was strong and hard. He had spoken of a mother's love. He felt then the sufferings of women, the weaknesses of their bodies and souls; and would shield them with a strong and resolute arm and bow his mind to them.</p></div><div id="container-2034"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2034">Away then: it is time to go. A voice spoke softly to Stephen's lonely heart, bidding him go and telling him that his friendship was coming to an end. Yes; he would go. He could not strive against another. He knew his part.</p></div><div id="container-2035"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2035">--Probably I shall go away, he said.</p></div><div id="container-2036"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2036">--Where? Cranly asked.</p></div><div id="container-2037"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2037">--Where I can, Stephen said.</p></div><div id="container-2038"><ul chunktype="poetry" class="poetry" id="chunk-2038"><li class="poetry-line" id="chunk-2038-line-1">--Yes, Cranly said. It might be difficult for you to live here now.</li><li class="poetry-line" id="chunk-2038-line-2">But is it that makes you go?</li></ul></div><div id="container-2039"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2039">--I have to go, Stephen answered.</p></div><div id="container-2040"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2040">--Because, Cranly continued, you need not look upon yourself as driven away if you do not wish to go or as a heretic or an outlaw. There are many good believers who think as you do. Would that surprise you? The church is not the stone building nor even the clergy and their dogmas. It is the whole mass of those born into it. I don't know what you wish to do in life. Is it what you told me the night we were standing outside Harcourt Street station?</p></div><div id="container-2041"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2041">--Yes, Stephen said, smiling in spite of himself at Cranly's way of remembering thoughts in connexion with places. The night you spent half an hour wrangling with Doherty about the shortest way from Sallygap to Larras.</p></div><div id="container-2042"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2042">--Pothead! Cranly said with calm contempt. What does he know about the way from Sallygap to Larras? Or what does he know about anything for that matter? And the big slobbering washing-pot head of him!</p></div><div id="container-2043"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2043">He broke into a loud long laugh.</p></div><div id="container-2044"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2044">--Well? Stephen said. Do you remember the rest?</p></div><div id="container-2045"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2045">--What you said, is it? Cranly asked. Yes, I remember it. To discover the mode of life or of art whereby your spirit could express itself in unfettered freedom.</p></div><div id="container-2046"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2046">Stephen raised his hat in acknowledgement.</p></div><div id="container-2047"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2047">--Freedom! Cranly repeated. But you are not free enough yet to commit a sacrilege. Tell me would you rob?</p></div><div id="container-2048"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2048">--I would beg first, Stephen said.</p></div><div id="container-2049"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2049">--And if you got nothing, would you rob?</p></div><div id="container-2050"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2050">--You wish me to say, Stephen answered, that the rights of property are provisional, and that in certain circumstances it is not unlawful to rob. Everyone would act in that belief. So I will not make you that answer. Apply to the jesuit theologian, Juan Mariana de Talavera, who will also explain to you in what circumstances you may lawfully Kill your king and whether you had better hand him his poison in a goblet or smear it for him upon his robe or his saddlebow. Ask me rather would I suffer others to rob me, or if they did, would I call down upon them what I believe is called the chastisement of the secular arm?</p></div><div id="container-2051"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2051">--And would you?</p></div><div id="container-2052"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2052">--I think, Stephen said, it would pain me as much to do so as to be robbed.</p></div><div id="container-2053"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2053">--I see, Cranly said.</p></div><div id="container-2054"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2054">He produced his match and began to clean the crevice between two teeth. Then he said carelessly:</p></div><div id="container-2055"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2055">--Tell me, for example, would you deflower a virgin?</p></div><div id="container-2056"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2056">--Excuse me, Stephen said politely, is that not the ambition of most young gentlemen?</p></div><div id="container-2057"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2057">--What then is your point of view? Cranly asked.</p></div><div id="container-2058"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2058">His last phrase, sour smelling as the smoke of charcoal and disheartening, excited Stephen's brain, over which its fumes seemed to brood.</p></div><div id="container-2059"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2059">--Look here, Cranly, he said. You have asked me what I would do and what I would not do. I will tell you what I will do and what I will not do. I will not serve that in which I no longer believe, whether it call itself my home, my fatherland, or my church: and I will try to express myself in some mode of life or art as freely as I can and as wholly as I can, using for my defence the only arms I allow myself to use--silence, exile, and cunning.</p></div><div id="container-2060"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2060">Cranly seized his arm and steered him round so as to lead him back towards Leeson Park. He laughed almost slyly and pressed Stephen's arm with an elder's affection.</p></div><div id="container-2061"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2061">--Cunning indeed! he said. Is it you? You poor poet, you!</p></div><div id="container-2062"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2062">--And you made me confess to you, Stephen said, thrilled by his touch, as I have confessed to you so many other things, have I not?</p></div><div id="container-2063"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2063">--Yes, my child, Cranly said, still gaily.</p></div><div id="container-2064"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2064">--You made me confess the fears that I have. But I will tell you also what I do not fear. I do not fear to be alone or to be spurned for another or to leave whatever I have to leave. And I am not afraid to make a mistake, even a great mistake, a lifelong mistake, and perhaps as long as eternity too.</p></div><div id="container-2065"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2065">Cranly, now grave again, slowed his pace and said:</p></div><div id="container-2066"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2066">--Alone, quite alone. You have no fear of that. And you know what that word means? Not only to be separate from all others but to have not even one friend.</p></div><div id="container-2067"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2067">--I will take the risk, said Stephen.</p></div><div id="container-2068"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2068">--And not to have any one person, Cranly said, who would be more than a friend, more even than the noblest and truest friend a man ever had.</p></div><div id="container-2069"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2069">His words seemed to have struck some deep chord in his own nature. Had he spoken of himself, of himself as he was or wished to be? Stephen watched his face for some moments in silence. A cold sadness was there. He had spoken of himself, of his own loneliness which he feared.</p></div><div id="container-2070"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2070">--Of whom are you speaking? Stephen asked at length.</p></div><div id="container-2071"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2071">Cranly did not answer.</p></div><div id="container-2072"><hr chunktype="separator" class="separator" id="chunk-2072"/></div><div id="container-2073"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2073">MARCH 20. Long talk with Cranly on the subject of my revolt.</p></div><div id="container-2074"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2074">He had his grand manner on. I supple and suave. Attacked me on the score of love for one's mother. Tried to imagine his mother: cannot. Told me once, in a moment of thoughtlessness, his father was sixty-one when he was born. Can see him. Strong farmer type. Pepper and salt suit. Square feet. Unkempt, grizzled beard. Probably attends coursing matches. Pays his dues regularly but not plentifully to Father Dwyer of Larras. Sometimes talks to girls after nightfall. But his mother? Very young or very old? Hardly the first. If so, Cranly would not have spoken as he did. Old then. Probably, and neglected. Hence Cranly's despair of soul: the child of exhausted loins.</p></div><div id="container-2075"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2075">MARCH 21, MORNING. Thought this in bed last night but was too lazy and free to add to it. Free, yes. The exhausted loins are those of Elizabeth and Zacchary. Then he is the precursor. Item: he eats chiefly belly bacon and dried figs. Read locusts and wild honey. Also, when thinking of him, saw always a stern severed head or death mask as if outlined on a grey curtain or veronica. Decollation they call it in the gold. Puzzled for the moment by saint John at the Latin gate. What do I see?

To escape held up relations between Jesus and Papa against those between Mary and her son. Said religion was not a lying-in hospital. Mother indulgent. Said I have a queer mind and have read too much. Not true. Have read little and understood less. Then she said I would come back to faith because I had a restless mind. This means to leave church by back door of sin and re-enter through the skylight of repentance. Cannot repent. Told her so and asked for sixpence. Got threepence.</p></div><div id="container-2080"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2080">Then went to college. Other wrangle with little round head rogue's eye Ghezzi. This time about Bruno the Nolan. Began in Italian and ended in pidgin English. He said Bruno was a terrible heretic. I said he was terribly burned. He agreed to this with some sorrow. Then gave me recipe for what he calls RISOTTO ALLA BERGAMASCA. When he pronounces a soft O he protrudes his full carnal lips as if he kissed the vowel. Has he? And could he repent? Yes, he could: and cry two round rogue's tears, one from each eye.</p></div><div id="container-2081"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2081">Crossing Stephen's, that is, my green, remembered that his countrymen and not mine had invented what Cranly the other night called our religion.

They are not as tall as men. One does not seem to stand quite apart from another. Their faces are phosphorescent, with darker streaks. They peer at me and their eyes seem to ask me something. They do not speak.</p></div><div id="container-2091"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2091">MARCH 30. This evening Cranly was in the porch of the library, proposing a problem to Dixon and her brother. A mother let her child fall into the Nile. Still harping on the mother. A crocodile seized the child. Mother asked it back. Crocodile said all right if she told him what he was going to do with the child, eat it or not eat It.</p></div><div id="container-2092"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2092">This mentality, Lepidus would say, is indeed bred out of your mud by the operation of your sun.</p></div><div id="container-2093"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2093">And mine? Is it not too? Then into Nile mud with it!</p></div><div id="container-2094"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2094">APRIL 1. Disapprove of this last phrase.</p></div><div id="container-2095"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2095">APRIL 2. Saw her drinking tea and eating cakes in Johnston's, Mooney and O'Brien's. Rather, lynx-eyed Lynch saw her as we passed. He tells me Cranly was invited there by brother. Did he bring his crocodile? Is he the shining light now? Well, I discovered him. I protest I did. Shining quietly behind a bushel of Wicklow bran.</p></div><div id="container-2096"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2096">APRIL 3. Met Davin at the cigar shop opposite Findlater's church. He was in a black sweater and had a hurley stick. Asked me was it true I was going away and why. Told him the shortest way to Tara was VIA Holyhead. Just then my father came up. Introduction. Father polite and observant. Asked Davin if he might offer him some refreshment. Davin could not, was going to a meeting. When we came away father told me he had a good honest eye. Asked me why I did not join a rowing club. I pretended to think it over. Told me then how he broke Pennyfeather's heart. Wants me to read law. Says I was cut out for that. More mud, more crocodiles.</p></div><div id="container-2097"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2097">APRIL 5. Wild spring. Scudding clouds. O life! Dark stream of swirling bogwater on which apple-trees have cast down their delicate flowers. Eyes of girls among the leaves. Girls demure and romping. All fair or auburn: no dark ones. They blush better. Houpla!</p></div><div id="container-2098"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2098">APRIL 6. Certainly she remembers the past. Lynch says all women do. Then she remembers the time of her childhood--and mine, if I was ever a child. The past is consumed in the present and the present is living only because it brings forth the future. Statues of women, if Lynch be right, should always be fully draped, one hand of the woman feeling regretfully her own hinder parts.</p></div><div id="container-2099"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2099">APRIL 6, LATER. Michael Robartes remembers forgotten beauty and, when his arms wrap her round, he presses in his arms the loveliness which has long faded from the world. Not this. Not at all. I desire to press in my arms the loveliness which has not yet come into the world.</p></div><div id="container-2100"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2100">APRIL 10. Faintly, under the heavy night, through the silence of the city which has turned from dreams to dreamless sleep as a weary lover whom no caresses move, the sound of hoofs upon the road. Not so faintly now as they come near the bridge; and in a moment, as they pass the darkened windows, the silence is cloven by alarm as by an arrow. They are heard now far away, hoofs that shine amid the heavy night as gems, hurrying beyond the sleeping fields to what journey's end--what heart? --bearing what tidings?</p></div><div id="container-2101"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2101">APRIL 11. Read what I wrote last night. Vague words for a vague emotion. Would she like it? I think so. Then I should have to like it also.</p></div><div id="container-2102"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2102">APRIL 13. That tundish has been on my mind for a long time. I looked it up and find it English and good old blunt English too. Damn the dean of studies and his funnel! What did he come here for to teach us his own language or to learn it from us. Damn him one way or the other!</p></div><div id="container-2103"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2103">APRIL 14. John Alphonsus Mulrennan has just returned from the west of Ireland. European and Asiatic papers please copy. He told us he met an old man there in a mountain cabin. Old man had red eyes and short pipe. Old man spoke Irish. Mulrennan spoke Irish. Then old man and Mulrennan spoke English. Mulrennan spoke to him about universe and stars. Old man sat, listened, smoked, spat. Then said:</p></div><div id="container-2104"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2104">--Ah, there must be terrible queer creatures at the latter end of the world.</p></div><div id="container-2105"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2105">I fear him. I fear his red-rimmed horny eyes. It is with him I must struggle all through this night till day come, till he or I lie dead, gripping him by the sinewy throat till... Till what? Till he yield to me? No. I mean no harm.</p></div><div id="container-2106"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2106">APRIL 15. Met her today point blank in Grafton Street. The crowd brought us together. We both stopped. She asked me why I never came, said she had heard all sorts of stories about me. This was only to gain time. Asked me was I writing poems? About whom? I asked her. This confused her more and I felt sorry and mean. Turned off that valve at once and opened the spiritual-heroic refrigerating apparatus, invented and patented in all countries by Dante Alighieri. Talked rapidly of myself and my plans. In the midst of it unluckily I made a sudden gesture of a revolutionary nature. I must have looked like a fellow throwing a handful of peas into the air. People began to look at us. She shook hands a moment after and, in going away, said she hoped I would do what I said.</p></div><div id="container-2107"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2107">Now I call that friendly, don't you?</p></div><div id="container-2108"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2108">Yes, I liked her today. A little or much? Don't know. I liked her and it seems a new feeling to me. Then, in that case, all the rest, all that I thought I thought and all that I felt I felt, all the rest before now, in fact... O, give it up, old chap! Sleep it off!</p></div><div id="container-2109"><p chunktype="misc" class="misc" id="chunk-2109">APRIL 16. Away! Away!</p></div><div id="container-2110"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2110">The spell of arms and voices: the white arms of roads, their promise of close embraces and the black arms of tall ships that stand against the moon, their tale of distant nations. They are held out to say: We are alone--come. And the voices say with them: We are your kinsmen. And the air is thick with their company as they call to me, their kinsman, making ready to go, shaking the wings of their exultant and terrible youth.</p></div><div id="container-2111"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2111">APRIL 26. Mother is putting my new secondhand clothes in order. She prays now, she says, that I may learn in my own life and away from home and friends what the heart is and what it feels. Amen. So be it. Welcome, O life, I go to encounter for the millionth time the reality of experience and to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race.</p></div><div id="container-2112"><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-2112">APRIL 27.
