He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with:</p><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-40">“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”</p><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-41">“We are not in a way to know <span class="italics">what</span> Mr. Bingley likes,” said her mother resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”</p><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-42">“But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.”</p><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-43">“I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her.”</p><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-44">“No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you.”</p><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-45">Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.</p><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-46">“Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven's sake! Have a little compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”</p><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-47">“Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times them ill.”</p><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-48">“I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty fretfully. “When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?”</p><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-49">“To-morrow fortnight.”</p><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-50">“Aye, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself.”</p><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-51">“Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr. Bingley to <span class="italics">her</span>.”</p><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-52">“Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teasing?”</p><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-53">“I honour your circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight. But if <span class="italics">we</span> do not venture somebody else will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her daughters must stand their chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.”</p><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-54">The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense, nonsense!”</p><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-55">“What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you <span class="italics">there</span>. What say you, Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read great books and make extracts.”</p><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-56">Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.</p><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-57">“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr. Bingley.”</p><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-58">“I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.</p><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-59">“I am sorry to hear <span class="italics">that</span>; but why did not you tell me that before? If I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.”</p><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-60">The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while.</p><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-61">“How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now.”</p><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-62">“Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.</p><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-63">“What an excellent father you have, girls!” said she, when the door was shut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but for your sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you <span class="italics">are</span> the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.”</p><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-64">“Oh!” said Lydia stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I <span class="italics">am</span> the youngest, I'm the tallest.”</p><p chunktype="prose" class="prose" id="chunk-65">The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner.</p></div><div class="previous-chapter-link"><a href="chapter-1.html">&lt;&lt; Previous Chapter</a></div><div class="next-chapter-link"><a href="chapter-3.html">Next Chapter &gt;&gt;</a></div><div class="table-of-contents-link"><a href="table-of-contents.html">Table of Contents</a></div></div><script src="../../../ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="../../static/js/vendor/jquery-1.10.2.min.js"><\/script>')</script><script src="../../static/js/plugins.js"></script><script>
