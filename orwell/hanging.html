        It was in Burma, a sodden morning of the rains. A sickly light, like yellow
        tinfoil, was slanting over the high walls into the jail yard. We were waiting
        outside the condemned cells, a row of sheds fronted with double bars, like
        small animal cages. Each cell measured about ten feet by ten and was quite bare
        within except for a plank bed and a pot of drinking water. In some of them
        brown silent men were squatting at the inner bars, with their blankets draped
        round them. These were the condemned men, due to be hanged within the next week
        or two.</p>
        <p>One prisoner had been brought out of his cell. He was a Hindu, a puny wisp
        of a man, with a shaven head and vague liquid eyes. He had a thick, sprouting
        moustache, absurdly too big for his body, rather like the moustache of a comic
        man on the films. Six tall Indian warders were guarding him and getting him
        ready for the gallows. Two of them stood by with rifles and fixed bayonets,
        while the others handcuffed him, passed a chain through his handcuffs and fixed
        it to their belts, and lashed his arms tight to his sides. They crowded very
        close about him, with their hands always on him in a careful, caressing grip,
        as though all the while feeling him to make sure he was there. It was like men
        handling a fish which is still alive and may jump back into the water. But he
        stood quite unresisting, yielding his arms limply to the ropes, as though he
        hardly noticed what was happening.</p>
        <p>Eight o&rsquo;clock struck and a bugle call, desolately thin in the wet air,
        floated from the distant barracks. The superintendent of the jail, who was
        standing apart from the rest of us, moodily prodding the gravel with his stick,
        raised his head at the sound. He was an army doctor, with a grey toothbrush
        moustache and a gruff voice. &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake hurry up, Francis,&rdquo; he said
        irritably. &ldquo;The man ought to have been dead by this time. Aren&rsquo;t you ready
        yet?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Francis, the head jailer, a fat Dravidian in a white drill suit and gold
        spectacles, waved his black hand. &ldquo;Yes sir, yes sir,&rdquo; he bubbled. &ldquo;All iss
        satisfactorily prepared. The hangman iss waiting. We shall proceed.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, quick march, then. The prisoners can&rsquo;t get their breakfast till this
        job&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>We set out for the gallows. Two warders marched on either side of the
        prisoner, with their rifles at the slope; two others marched close against him,
        gripping him by arm and shoulder, as though at once pushing and supporting him.
        The rest of us, magistrates and the like, followed behind. Suddenly, when we
        had gone ten yards, the procession stopped short without any order or warning.
        A dreadful thing had happened&ndash;a dog, come goodness knows whence, had
        appeared in the yard. It came bounding among us with a loud volley of barks,
        and leapt round us wagging its whole body, wild with glee at finding so many
        human beings together. It was a large woolly dog, half Airedale, half pariah.
        For a moment it pranced round us, and then, before anyone could stop it, it had
        made a dash for the prisoner, and jumping up tried to lick his face. Everyone
        stood aghast, too taken aback even to grab at the dog.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Who let that bloody brute in here?&rdquo; said the superintendent angrily. &ldquo;Catch
        it, someone!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>A warder, detached from the escort, charged clumsily after the dog, but it
        danced and gambolled just out of his reach, taking everything as part of the
        game. A young Eurasian jailer picked up a handful of gravel and tried to stone
        the dog away, but it dodged the stones and came after us again. Its yaps echoed
        from the jail wails. The prisoner, in the grasp of the two warders, looked on
        incuriously, as though this was another formality of the hanging. It was
        several minutes before someone managed to catch the dog. Then we put my
        handkerchief through its collar and moved off once more, with the dog still
        straining and whimpering.</p>
        <p>It was about forty yards to the gallows. I watched the bare brown back of
        the prisoner marching in front of me. He walked clumsily with his bound arms,
        but quite steadily, with that bobbing gait of the Indian who never straightens
        his knees. At each step his muscles slid neatly into place, the lock of hair on
        his scalp danced up and down, his feet printed themselves on the wet gravel.
        And once, in spite of the men who gripped him by each shoulder, he stepped
        slightly aside to avoid a puddle on the path.</p>
        <p>It is curious, but till that moment I had never realized what it means to
        destroy a healthy, conscious man. When I saw the prisoner step aside to avoid
        the puddle, I saw the mystery, the unspeakable wrongness, of cutting a life
        short when it is in full tide. This man was not dying, he was alive just as we
        were alive. All the organs of his body were working&ndash;bowels digesting
        food, skin renewing itself, nails growing, tissues forming&ndash;all toiling
        away in solemn foolery. His nails would still be growing when he stood on the
        drop, when he was falling through the air with a tenth of a second to live. His
        eyes saw the yellow gravel and the grey walls, and his brain still remembered,
        foresaw, reasoned&ndash;reasoned even about puddles. He and we were a party of
        men walking together, seeing, hearing, feeling, understanding the same world;
        and in two minutes, with a sudden snap, one of us would be gone&ndash;one mind
        less, one world less.</p>
        <p>The gallows stood in a small yard, separate from the main grounds of the
        prison, and overgrown with tall prickly weeds. It was a brick erection like
        three sides of a shed, with planking on top, and above that two beams and a
        crossbar with the rope dangling. The hangman, a grey-haired convict in the
        white uniform of the prison, was waiting beside his machine. He greeted us with
        a servile crouch as we entered. At a word from Francis the two warders,
        gripping the prisoner more closely than ever, half led, half pushed him to the
        gallows and helped him clumsily up the ladder. Then the hangman climbed up and
        fixed the rope round the prisoner&rsquo;s neck.</p>
        <p>We stood waiting, five yards away. The warders had formed in a rough circle
        round the gallows. And then, when the noose was fixed, the prisoner began
        crying out on his god. It was a high, reiterated cry of &ldquo;Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram!&rdquo;,
        not urgent and fearful like a prayer or a cry for help, but steady, rhythmical,
        almost like the tolling of a bell. The dog answered the sound with a whine. The
        hangman, still standing on the gallows, produced a small cotton bag like a
        flour bag and drew it down over the prisoner&rsquo;s face. But the sound, muffled by
        the cloth, still persisted, over and over again: &ldquo;Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>The hangman climbed down and stood ready, holding the lever. Minutes seemed
        to pass. The steady, muffled crying from the prisoner went on and on, &ldquo;Ram!
        Ram! Ram!&rdquo; never faltering for an instant. The superintendent, his head on his
        chest, was slowly poking the ground with his stick; perhaps he was counting the
        cries, allowing the prisoner a fixed number&ndash;fifty, perhaps, or a hundred.
        Everyone had changed colour. The Indians had gone grey like bad coffee, and one
        or two of the bayonets were wavering. We looked at the lashed, hooded man on
        the drop, and listened to his cries&ndash;each cry another second of life; the
        same thought was in all our minds: oh, kill him quickly, get it over, stop that
        abominable noise!</p>
        <p>Suddenly the superintendent made up his mind. Throwing up his head he made a
        swift motion with his stick. &ldquo;Chalo!&rdquo; he shouted almost fiercely.</p>
        <p>There was a clanking noise, and then dead silence. The prisoner had
        vanished, and the rope was twisting on itself. I let go of the dog, and it
        galloped immediately to the back of the gallows; but when it got there it
        stopped short, barked, and then retreated into a corner of the yard, where it
        stood among the weeds, looking timorously out at us. We went round the gallows
        to inspect the prisoner&rsquo;s body. He was dangling with his toes pointed straight
        downwards, very slowly revolving, as dead as a stone.</p>
        <p>The superintendent reached out with his stick and poked the bare body; it
        oscillated, slightly. &ldquo;<i>He&rsquo;s</i> all right,&rdquo; said the superintendent. He backed out
        from under the gallows, and blew out a deep breath. The moody look had gone out
        of his face quite suddenly. He glanced at his wrist-watch. &ldquo;Eight minutes past
        eight. Well, that&rsquo;s all for this morning, thank God.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>The warders unfixed bayonets and marched away. The dog, sobered and
        conscious of having misbehaved itself, slipped after them. We walked out of the
        gallows yard, past the condemned cells with their waiting prisoners, into the
        big central yard of the prison. The convicts, under the command of warders
        armed with lathis, were already receiving their breakfast. They squatted in
        long rows, each man holding a tin pannikin, while two warders with buckets
        marched round ladling out rice; it seemed quite a homely, jolly scene, after
        the hanging. An enormous relief had come upon us now that the job was done. One
        felt an impulse to sing, to break into a run, to snigger. All at once everyone
        began chattering gaily.</p>
        <p>The Eurasian boy walking beside me nodded towards the way we had come, with
        a knowing smile: &ldquo;Do you know, sir, our friend (he meant the dead man), when he
        heard his appeal had been dismissed, he pissed on the floor of his cell. From
        fright.&ndash;Kindly take one of my cigarettes, sir. Do you not admire my new
        silver case, sir? From the boxwallah, two rupees eight annas. Classy European
        style.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Several people laughed&ndash;at what, nobody seemed certain.</p>
        <p>Francis was walking by the superintendent, talking garrulously. &ldquo;Well, sir,
        all hass passed off with the utmost satisfactoriness. It wass all
        finished&ndash;flick! like that. It iss not always so&ndash;oah, no! I have
        known cases where the doctor wass obliged to go beneath the gallows and pull
        the prisoner&rsquo;s legs to ensure decease. Most disagreeable!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Wriggling about, eh? That&rsquo;s bad,&rdquo; said the superintendent.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Ach, sir, it iss worse when they become refractory! One man, I recall,
        clung to the bars of hiss cage when we went to take him out. You will scarcely
        credit, sir, that it took six warders to dislodge him, three pulling at each
        leg. We reasoned with him. &lsquo;My dear fellow,&rsquo; we said, 'think of all the pain
        and trouble you are causing to us!&rsquo; But no, he would not listen! Ach, he wass
        very troublesome!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>I found that I was laughing quite loudly. Everyone was laughing. Even the
        superintendent grinned in a tolerant way. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better all come out and have a
        drink,&rdquo; he said quite genially. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a bottle of whisky in the car. We
        could do with it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>We went through the big double gates of the prison, into the road. &ldquo;Pulling
        at his legs!&rdquo; exclaimed a Burmese magistrate suddenly, and burst into a loud
        chuckling. We all began laughing again. At that moment Francis&rsquo;s anecdote
        seemed extraordinarily funny. We all had a drink together, native and European
        alike, quite amicably. The dead man was a hundred yards away.</p>      </div>
